**What is Financing?**

Financing is using borrowed money (mortgage) to buy real estate. Instead of paying cash, you use a loan and pay it back over time.

**Why Use Financing (Leverage)?**

**Buy More Property**: $100,000 can buy $500,000 property (20% down).

**Preserve Capital**: Keep cash for other investments or emergencies.

**Amplify Returns**: Leverage increases returns on your investment.

**Tax Benefits**: Mortgage interest is deductible.

**The Power of Leverage:**

**Example Without Leverage**:

- Buy property cash: $200,000
- Appreciation: $20,000 (10%)
- Return: 10% on $200,000

**Example With Leverage (20% Down)**:

- Down payment: $40,000
- Loan: $160,000
- Appreciation: $20,000 (10% of property value)
- Return on your $40,000: 50%

**But**: Leverage also amplifies losses if property value decreases.

**Types of Mortgages:**

**1. Conventional Loans**

**What**: Standard mortgages from banks/lenders.

**Requirements**:

- 20% down (or PMI with less)
- Good credit (620+)
- Debt-to-income ratio <43%
- Stable income

**Terms**: 15 or 30 years

**Rates**: Vary by market, credit, down payment

**2. FHA Loans**

**What**: Government-backed loans, easier to qualify.

**Requirements**:

- 3.5% down (with good credit)
- Credit score 580+ (500+ with 10% down)
- Lower income requirements
- Must live in property (owner-occupied)

**Pros**: Lower down payment, easier qualification
**Cons**: PMI for life of loan, limits on property types

**3. VA Loans**

**What**: Loans for veterans/military.

**Requirements**:

- 0% down (no down payment)
- No PMI
- Must be veteran/active military
- Must live in property

**Pros**: No down payment, no PMI, good rates
**Cons**: Limited to veterans/military

**4. Investment Property Loans**

**What**: Loans for rental properties (not owner-occupied).

**Requirements**:

- 20-25% down (higher than owner-occupied)
- Higher credit score (680+)
- Lower debt-to-income ratio
- Higher interest rates (0.5-1% higher)

**Pros**: Can buy rental properties
**Cons**: Higher down payment, higher rates

**5. Hard Money Loans**

**What**: Short-term loans from private lenders.

**Requirements**:

- 20-30% down
- Higher interest (10-15%+)
- Short term (6-24 months)
- Asset-based (property value, not credit)

**Use**: Fix-and-flip, quick purchases, bridge loans

**Pros**: Fast approval, flexible
**Cons**: High rates, short term, expensive

**Mortgage Terms:**

**Principal**: Amount borrowed

**Interest**: Cost of borrowing

**Term**: Length of loan (15 or 30 years)

**Rate**: Interest rate (fixed or adjustable)

**Down Payment**: Cash you put down (typically 20%)

**PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance)**: Required if down payment <20%

**Mortgage Payment Components:**

**P&I (Principal and Interest)**:

- Principal: Paying down loan
- Interest: Cost of borrowing

**Escrow**:

- Property taxes
- Homeowners insurance
- PMI (if applicable)

**Total Payment**: P&I + Escrow

**Example**:

- P&I: $1,200
- Taxes: $200
- Insurance: $100
- PMI: $100
- **Total**: $1,600/month

**Refinancing:**

**What is Refinancing**: Replacing existing mortgage with new loan.

**Why Refinance**:

**1. Lower Interest Rate**

**Example**:

- Current rate: 6%
- New rate: 4%
- Savings: 2% on loan balance

**When**: Rates drop significantly (1%+ lower).

**2. Cash-Out Refinance**

**What**: Borrow more than you owe, take cash out.

**Example**:

- Current loan: $150,000
- Property value: $250,000
- New loan: $200,000 (80% of value)
- Cash out: $50,000

**Use**:

- Buy more properties
- Renovations
- Pay off debt
- Other investments

**3. Change Loan Terms**

**30-Year to 15-Year**: Pay off faster, higher payment

**Adjustable to Fixed**: Lock in rate

**4. Remove PMI**

**When**: Property value increased, equity >20%

**Refinancing Costs:**

**Closing Costs**:

- Origination fees: 0.5-1% of loan
- Appraisal: $300-500
- Title insurance: $500-1,000
- Other fees: $1,000-2,000

**Total**: Usually 2-5% of loan amount

**Example**:

- Loan: $200,000
- Closing costs: $6,000 (3%)

**Break-Even**: Calculate how long to recoup costs.

**Example**:

- Monthly savings: $200
- Closing costs: $6,000
- Break-even: 30 months

**If staying <30 months**: Not worth it.

**The Refinancing Decision:**

**Calculate Savings**:

**Current Payment**: $1,600/month
**New Payment**: $1,400/month
**Monthly Savings**: $200
**Annual Savings**: $2,400

**Calculate Break-Even**:

- Closing costs: $6,000
- Monthly savings: $200
- Break-even: 30 months

**Decision**:

- Staying >30 months? Refinance
- Staying <30 months? Don't refinance

**Using Leverage Wisely:**

**Good Leverage**:

- Positive cash flow after debt service
- Property appreciating
- Good location
- Reserve funds for emergencies
- Conservative debt-to-income ratio

**Bad Leverage**:

- Negative cash flow
- No reserves
- Over-leveraged (too much debt)
- Risky properties
- Can't afford payments if vacancy

**The 75% Rule** (Conservative Leverage):

**Rule**: Don't borrow more than 75% of property value.

**Example**:

- Property value: $200,000
- Maximum loan: $150,000 (75%)
- Down payment: $50,000 (25%)

**Why**: Maintains equity cushion, safer position.

**Common Financing Mistakes:**

**Over-Leveraging**: Borrowing too much, can't afford payments.

**Solution**: Keep debt manageable. Maintain reserves.

**Not Shopping Rates**: Taking first offer.

**Solution**: Shop around. Compare rates and fees.

**Ignoring Closing Costs**: Only looking at rate.

**Solution**: Calculate total cost including fees.

**Refinancing Too Often**: Paying fees repeatedly.

**Solution**: Only refinance if significant savings.

**Not Understanding Terms**: Signing without reading.

**Solution**: Understand all terms. Ask questions.

**No Reserves**: No cash for emergencies.

**Solution**: Keep 6+ months of expenses in reserves.
