**What is Real Estate Investing?**

Real estate investing is purchasing property to generate income, build equity, or both. Unlike stocks (paper assets), real estate is a physical asset you can see and touch.

**Why Real Estate?**

**Cash Flow**: Rental income can provide monthly income.

**Appreciation**: Property values typically increase over time.

**Leverage**: Use borrowed money (mortgages) to buy more property.

**Tax Benefits**: Depreciation, deductions, and tax advantages.

**Inflation Hedge**: Property values and rents tend to rise with inflation.

**Diversification**: Different asset class from stocks/bonds.

**Types of Real Estate Investments:**

**Pros**:

**3. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**

**What**: Companies that own real estate, trade like stocks.

**Pros**:

- Liquid (easy to buy/sell)

- Live rent-free or reduced rent
- Learn while doing

**Cons**:

- Live with tenants
- Less privacy
- More management

**How Real Estate Creates Wealth:**

**1. Cash Flow**

**Rental Income - Expenses = Cash Flow**

**Example**:

- Monthly rent: $2,000
- Mortgage: $1,200
- Expenses: $300
- Cash flow: $500/month = $6,000/year

**2. Appreciation**

**Property Value Increases Over Time**:

**Example**:

- Buy property: $200,000
- Value after 10 years: $300,000
- Appreciation: $100,000

**3. Loan Paydown**

**Tenant Pays Down Your Mortgage**:

**Example**:

- Mortgage payment: $1,200/month
- Principal portion: $300/month
- After 10 years: $36,000 in equity from paydown

**4. Tax Benefits**

**Deductions**:

- Mortgage interest
- Property taxes
- Depreciation
- Repairs and maintenance
- Property management

**Total Return Example**:

**Property Purchase**: $200,000
**Down Payment**: $40,000 (20%)

**Over 10 Years**:

- Cash flow: $60,000 ($500/month × 10 years)
- Appreciation: $100,000
- Loan paydown: $36,000
- **Total Return**: $196,000

**On $40,000 investment = 490% return (49% per year average)**

**But**: This assumes everything goes well. Real estate has risks.

**The Power of Leverage:**

**What is Leverage**: Using borrowed money to buy property.

**Example Without Leverage**:

- Buy property cash: $200,000
- Appreciation: $50,000 (25%)
- Return: 25%

**Example With Leverage**:

- Buy property with 20% down: $40,000
- Appreciation: $50,000 (25% of property value)
- Return on your $40,000: 125%

**Leverage Amplifies Returns**: But also amplifies losses.

**Risks of Real Estate:**

**1. Market Risk**: Property values can decrease.

**2. Vacancy Risk**: No tenants = no income, still pay expenses.

**3. Maintenance Costs**: Unexpected repairs can be expensive.

**4. Tenant Issues**: Bad tenants, evictions, damage.

**5. Liquidity Risk**: Hard to sell quickly if needed.

**6. Interest Rate Risk**: Rising rates increase costs.

**7. Location Risk**: Bad location = poor returns.

**8. Leverage Risk**: Owing more than property is worth.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand real estate basics, let's learn about analyzing real estate deals. The next module covers how to evaluate properties and calculate returns.

## Real Example

Simple cap rate example: A property priced at $250,000 with $24,000 annual gross rent and $6,000 annual expenses yields NOI = $18,000. Cap rate = NOI / Price = 18,000 / 250,000 = 7.2%. Compare cap rates across similar properties in the same market; always account for realistic vacancy and maintenance.
