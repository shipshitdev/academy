# Analyzing Real Estate Deals: The Numbers That Matter

## Learning Objective

Learn how to analyze real estate deals, calculate cash flow, ROI, and other key metrics to make informed investment decisions.

## Main Content

**Why Analysis Matters:**

**Bad Deals Lose Money**: Buying wrong property = negative cash flow, losses.

**Good Deals Make Money**: Right property = positive cash flow, appreciation.

**The Difference**: Analysis separates winners from losers.

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**

**1. Cash Flow**

**Formula**: Rental Income - All Expenses = Cash Flow

**Calculation**:

**Monthly Income**:

- Rental income: $2,000

**Monthly Expenses**:

- Mortgage (P&I): $1,200
- Property taxes: $200
- Insurance: $100
- Maintenance (10% of rent): $200
- Property management (10% of rent): $200
- Vacancy reserve (5% of rent): $100
- **Total Expenses**: $2,000

**Cash Flow**:

- Income: $2,000
- Expenses: $2,000
- **Cash Flow**: $0/month

**This is a Bad Deal**: No cash flow, no buffer for unexpected expenses.

**Good Deal Example**:

- Income: $2,000
- Expenses: $1,400
- **Cash Flow**: $600/month = $7,200/year

**2. Cash-on-Cash Return (CoC)**

**Formula**: Annual Cash Flow ÷ Cash Invested = CoC Return

**Example**:

- Annual cash flow: $7,200
- Cash invested (down payment + closing costs): $45,000
- CoC Return: $7,200 ÷ $45,000 = 16%

**Target**: 8-12%+ CoC is good for rental properties.

**3. Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)**

**Formula**: Net Operating Income ÷ Property Value = Cap Rate

**NOI Calculation**:

- Annual rental income: $24,000
- Operating expenses (no mortgage): $8,000
- **NOI**: $16,000

**Cap Rate**:

- NOI: $16,000
- Property value: $200,000
- Cap Rate: $16,000 ÷ $200,000 = 8%

**Target**: 6-10%+ cap rate is good (varies by market).

**Use**: Compare properties, evaluate if good deal.

**4. Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM)**

**Formula**: Property Price ÷ Annual Gross Rent = GRM

**Example**:

- Property price: $200,000
- Annual rent: $24,000
- GRM: $200,000 ÷ $24,000 = 8.3

**Use**: Quick comparison. Lower GRM = better (faster payback).

**Target**: 8-12 GRM is typical (varies by market).

**5. Return on Investment (ROI)**

**Formula**: (Cash Flow + Appreciation + Loan Paydown) ÷ Cash Invested = ROI

**Example** (1 year):

- Cash flow: $7,200
- Appreciation: $10,000 (5%)
- Loan paydown: $3,600
- Total return: $20,800
- Cash invested: $45,000
- ROI: $20,800 ÷ $45,000 = 46%

**6. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)**

**Formula**: Net Operating Income ÷ Annual Debt Service = DSCR

**Example**:

- NOI: $16,000/year
- Annual mortgage payments: $14,400/year
- DSCR: $16,000 ÷ $14,400 = 1.11

**Target**: 1.25+ (banks want this for loans).

**Below 1.0**: Negative cash flow (bad).

**The Deal Analysis Process:**

**Step 1: Gather Information**

**Property Details**:

- Purchase price
- Property type (single-family, multi-family, etc.)
- Square footage
- Bedrooms/bathrooms
- Year built
- Condition

**Financial Information**:

- Current rent (if occupied)
- Market rent (if vacant)
- Property taxes
- Insurance costs
- HOA fees (if applicable)
- Utilities (who pays)

**Financing**:

- Down payment required
- Interest rate
- Loan term
- Closing costs

**Step 2: Estimate Income**

**Rental Income**:

- Research comparable rents
- Check market rates
- Evaluate property condition
- Be conservative (don't overestimate)

**Other Income** (if applicable):

- Parking fees
- Laundry
- Storage

**Step 3: Estimate Expenses**

**Operating Expenses**:

**Fixed Expenses** (Same every month):

- Mortgage (P&I)
- Property taxes
- Insurance
- HOA fees (if applicable)

**Variable Expenses** (Estimate):

- Maintenance: 10% of rent
- Repairs: 5-10% of rent
- Property management: 10% of rent (if using)
- Vacancy: 5-10% of rent
- Capital expenditures: 5% of rent (roof, HVAC, etc.)

**Total**: Usually 40-50% of rent (excluding mortgage).

**Step 4: Calculate Cash Flow**

**Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses = Cash Flow**

**Target**: Positive cash flow of $100-500+ per unit.

**Step 5: Calculate Returns**

**Cash-on-Cash Return**: 8-12%+ target

**Cap Rate**: 6-10%+ target (varies by market)

**ROI**: Account for all returns (cash flow, appreciation, paydown)

**Step 6: Make Decision**

**Good Deal If**:

- Positive cash flow
- Good CoC return (8%+)
- Good location
- Fair condition
- Good financing

**Pass If**:

- Negative cash flow
- Low returns
- Bad location
- Poor condition
- Expensive financing

**The 1% Rule** (Quick Check):

**Rule**: Monthly rent should be 1%+ of purchase price.

**Example**:

- Purchase price: $200,000
- Monthly rent should be: $2,000+ (1%)

**Use**: Quick screening. If rent <1% of price, likely not a good deal.

**Note**: This rule doesn't work in expensive markets (CA, NY, etc.). Use as guideline only.

**The 50% Rule** (Expense Estimate):

**Rule**: Operating expenses (excluding mortgage) = 50% of rent.

**Example**:

- Monthly rent: $2,000
- Operating expenses: $1,000 (50%)
- Mortgage: $1,200
- Cash flow: -$200 (negative)

**Use**: Quick expense estimate. Adjust for your market.

**Common Analysis Mistakes:**

**Overestimating Rent**: Assuming highest possible rent.

**Underestimating Expenses**: Missing expenses or underestimating costs.

**Solution**: Include all expenses. Use 50% rule as check. Add buffer.

**Ignoring Vacancy**: Assuming 100% occupancy.

**Solution**: Factor in 5-10% vacancy rate.

**Ignoring Maintenance**: Not accounting for repairs.

**Solution**: Budget 10-15% for maintenance and repairs.

**Not Factoring All Costs**: Missing closing costs, repairs, etc.

**Solution**: Include all costs in analysis.
