## Learning Objective
Learn about cryptocurrency exchanges, how to choose one, and the basics of buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST

Before we dive in, let's be crystal clear: **There is no free lunch. This is not going to be easy. Success is not guaranteed.**

Trading requires real work, discipline, and consistent effort. More importantly, **YOU CAN LOSE YOUR CAPITAL. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING.** Trading cryptocurrency is extremely risky. Most traders lose money. You can lose your entire investment. Exchanges can be hacked, go bankrupt, or freeze your account. This is not guaranteed to make money—it's guaranteed to be risky. Don't be stupid—only invest what you can afford to lose completely, start small, learn properly, stay disciplined, and understand that you could lose everything you put in.

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms where you buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. Think of them like stock exchanges for digital assets. Here's what you need to know:

**Types of Exchanges**:

- **Cons**: Not your keys, can be hacked, regulatory risk

**Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)**:
- Peer-to-peer trading, no central authority
- You control your keys
- More complex, higher learning curve
- Examples: Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap
- **Pros**: True ownership, no KYC usually

**Trading Basics**:

**Market Orders**: Buy/sell immediately at current market price. Fast but price may vary slightly.

**Limit Orders**: Set specific price you want to buy/sell at. Order executes when price reaches your limit. Better control, but may not fill.

**Stop Loss Orders**: Automatically sell if price drops to certain level. Limits losses.

**Trading Pairs**: Most exchanges trade cryptocurrencies against each other (BTC/USD, ETH/BTC, etc.).

**Reading Exchange Interface**:
- **Order Book**: Shows buy/sell orders
- **Price Chart**: Historical and current prices
- **Trade History**: Recent transactions
- **Your Balance**: Available and locked funds

**Fees to Understand**:

**Trading Fees**: Usually 0.1-0.5% per trade. Some exchanges offer discounts for using their native token (BNB on Binance reduces fees).

**Deposit Fees**: Usually free for bank transfers, fees for credit cards.

**Withdrawal Fees**: Varies by cryptocurrency. Bitcoin withdrawals often cost $5-20 in network fees.

**Spread**: Difference between buy and sell price. More liquid markets have smaller spreads.

**Best Practices**:

**Start Small**: Practice with small amounts to learn the platform.

**Use Limit Orders**: Better price control than market orders.

**Understand Fees**: Calculate total cost before trading.

**Secure Your Account**: 2FA, strong password, withdrawal limits.

**Don't Leave Large Amounts on Exchange**: Move to personal wallet for long-term storage.

**Research Before Trading**: Don't trade cryptocurrencies you don't understand.

**Common Mistakes**:
- Trading without understanding fees
- Leaving large amounts on exchange
- Not enabling 2FA
- Trading emotionally (FOMO, panic selling)
