# Email Marketing and Newsletters

## Learning Objective
Build and grow an email list, create engaging newsletters, and use email marketing to build relationships and drive revenue.

Email marketing is owning your audience. Unlike social media, you control the relationship. You're not at the mercy of algorithms.

**Why Email Marketing Works:**

**Direct Access**: You reach subscribers directly. No algorithm between you and them.

**High ROI**: Email generates $42 for every $1 spent. Highest ROI of any marketing channel.

**The AI-Accelerated Email Workflow:**

**With AI (2026)**:
- Write newsletter: 30-60 minutes
- Create welcome sequence: 1-2 hours
- Write promotional emails: 15-30 minutes each

**Common Mistakes:**

**Too Promotional**: Constant sales pitches. People unsubscribe.

**No Value**: All promotion, no value. Build trust first.

**Inconsistent**: Sending randomly. People forget you.

**No Segmentation**: Same email to everyone. Low engagement.

**Poor Subject Lines**: Boring or spammy. Low open rates.

**Ignoring Analytics**: Not tracking opens, clicks, unsubscribes.

**Buying Lists**: Illegal and ineffective. Build organically.
