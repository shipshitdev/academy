Social media requires consistent content, but creating posts daily is exhausting. AI can help you batch-create a month's worth of content in one session.

**Project: Create a 7-Day Content Calendar**

**Step 1: Define Your Strategy**
Start with your goals and audience:
Prompt: "I'm a [your niche/role] creating content for [platform]. My audience is [describe]. Create a 7-day content strategy that includes: 2 educational posts, 2 inspirational posts, 1 behind-the-scenes, 1 question/poll, and 1 promotional post."

**Step 2: Generate Post Ideas**
Prompt: "Based on this strategy, generate 7 specific post ideas with hooks that would grab attention on [platform]. Each idea should include: a compelling headline, the main message, and why it resonates with [your audience]."

**Step 3: Write Complete Captions**
For each post idea:
Prompt: "Write a social media caption for [platform] about [topic]. Requirements: [length], [tone], include a hook, value, and call-to-action. Format with line breaks for readability."

**Step 4: Create Variations**
Platforms have different formats:
Prompt: "Adapt this caption for [different platform]. [Platform] requirements: [character limit, tone, format]."

**Step 5: Generate Hashtags**
Prompt: "Generate 10 relevant hashtags for a post about [topic]. Mix popular and niche hashtags. Include 3 branded/niche-specific options."

**Step 6: Create Visual Descriptions**
For posts needing images:
Prompt: "Describe an image that would accompany this post: [paste caption]. The image should be [style], [mood], and clearly represent the message."

**Step 7: Build Your Calendar**
