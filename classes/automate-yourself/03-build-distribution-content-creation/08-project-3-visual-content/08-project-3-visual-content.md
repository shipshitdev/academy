# Project 3: Create Images for Content

## Learning Objective
Learn to create high-quality images using modern image generation tools to create visuals that complement your written content.

## Main Content

Visual content dramatically increases engagement. AI image generation makes creating custom graphics accessible without design skills.

**Getting Started with Image Generation**

**Step 1: Choose Your Tool**
- **Midjourney** (Discord-based): Best for artistic, high-quality images. Requires subscription.
- **DALL-E 3** (via ChatGPT Plus): Integrated with ChatGPT, great for specific, detailed images.
- **Canva AI**: Easy for beginners, includes editing tools.

**Step 2: Master Prompt Structure**
Image prompts need detail:
Bad: "A business person"
Good: "Professional business person in modern office, confident pose, natural lighting, clean background, photorealistic style, high quality"

**Essential Prompt Elements**:
- Subject: What/who is in the image
- Style: Photorealistic, illustration, minimalist, etc.
- Mood: Professional, energetic, calm, etc.
- Composition: Close-up, wide shot, rule of thirds
- Technical: Lighting, colors, quality

**Step 3: Create Images for Your Content**
For a blog post about productivity:
Prompt: "Minimalist illustration of a morning routine, flat design style, soft pastel colors, clean and modern, showing sunrise, coffee, and journal, perfect for blog header image"

For social media:
Prompt: "Square format quote card design, modern typography, professional blue and white color scheme, motivational quote layout, suitable for Instagram post"

**Step 4: Refine and Iterate**
- Generate multiple variations
- Ask for specific changes: "Make it more colorful," "Add [element]," "Change the background to [style]"
- Use negative prompts: "Avoid [element]," "No [style]"

**Step 5: Edit and Optimize**
- Use Canva or similar tools to add text overlays
- Adjust colors to match your brand
- Resize for different platforms (Instagram square vs. blog header)

**Common Use Cases**:
- Blog post featured images
- Social media graphics
- Email newsletter headers
- Presentation slides
- Product mockups
