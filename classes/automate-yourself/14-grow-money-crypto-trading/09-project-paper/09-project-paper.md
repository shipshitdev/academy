# Project 2: Practice with Paper Trading

## Learning Objective
Hands-on project: Practice executing your trading plan using paper trading (virtual money) to build confidence and test your strategy before risking real capital.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST

Before we dive in, let's be crystal clear: **There is no free lunch. This is not going to be easy. Success is not guaranteed.**

Paper trading requires real work, discipline, and consistent effort. More importantly, **YOU CAN LOSE YOUR CAPITAL. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING.** Even with successful paper trading, you can still lose your entire account when you go live. Most traders lose money. Trading is extremely risky. This is not guaranteed to make money—it's guaranteed to be risky. Don't be stupid—only trade with money you can afford to lose completely, practice extensively, stay disciplined, and understand that you could lose everything you put in.

## Main Content

Paper trading is practicing with virtual money. It's risk-free but feels real enough to develop skills. Here's how to do it effectively:

**Why Paper Trade**:

**Benefits**:
- Learn platform mechanics without risk
- Test your trading plan
- Build confidence in your strategy
- Practice emotional control
- Identify weaknesses before real trading

**Limitations**:
- No real emotions (fear/greed are different)
- Slippage and execution may differ
- Can develop bad habits if not taken seriously

**Setting Up Paper Trading**:

**Step 1: Choose Platform**
- Most brokers offer demo/paper trading accounts
- TradingView has paper trading feature
- Use same platform you'll use for real trading

**Step 2: Set Realistic Account Size**
- Use amount similar to your real capital
- Don't use $1 million if you'll trade with $1,000
- Realistic size = realistic position sizing

**Step 3: Treat It Like Real Money**
- Follow your trading plan exactly
- Use proper position sizing
- Set stop losses and take profits
- Track all trades
- Don't "reset" after losses

**Step 4: Practice Routine**
- Follow your daily routine
- Pre-market analysis
- Execute trades per your plan
- Post-market review
- Journal everything

**What to Practice**:

**Platform Skills**:
- Placing orders correctly
- Setting stop losses and take profits
- Reading charts and indicators
- Using order types (limit, market, stop)
- Navigating platform quickly

**Trading Skills**:
- Identifying setups per your plan
- Executing entries and exits
- Managing positions
- Handling multiple positions
- Reacting to market changes

**Emotional Skills**:
- Sticking to plan under pressure (simulated)
- Accepting losses (even virtual ones)
- Not overtrading
- Patience for setups
- Discipline

**Performance Tracking**:

Track these metrics:
- Win rate (% of winning trades)
- Average win vs. average loss
- Risk-reward ratio achieved
- Maximum drawdown
- Trades per day/week
- Emotional state per trade

**Paper Trading Timeline**:

**Week 1-2**: Learn platform, make mistakes, get comfortable
**Week 3-4**: Focus on following your plan consistently
**Week 5-8**: Achieve consistent execution of your plan
**Week 9-12**: Demonstrate profitability and discipline

**Success Criteria**:

Before going live, you should:
- [ ] Win rate above 40% (if using 2:1+ risk-reward)
- [ ] Following plan consistently (no emotional deviations)
- [ ] Comfortable with platform mechanics
- [ ] Profitable over at least 30 trades
- [ ] Handling losses emotionally well
- [ ] Sticking to risk management rules

**Common Mistakes**:
- Not taking it seriously (develops bad habits)
- Overtrading (because it's "free")
- Not following plan (defeats the purpose)
- Going live too early (before proving profitability)
- Using unrealistic account sizes

**Transitioning to Live Trading**:

When ready:
- Start with smallest position sizes
- Use same plan you paper traded
- Expect emotions to be stronger
- Monitor closely for first month
- Scale up gradually as you prove profitability

**Paper Trading Project**:

**30-Day Challenge**:
1. Set up paper trading account
2. Trade your plan for 30 days
3. Journal every trade (setup, entry, exit, emotions)
4. Track all metrics
5. Review at end: What worked? What didn't?
6. Adjust plan if needed
