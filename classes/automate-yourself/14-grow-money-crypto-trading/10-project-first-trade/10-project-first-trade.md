# Project 3: Execute and Document Your First Trade

## Learning Objective
Hands-on project: Execute your first real trade following your trading plan, then document everything to learn from the experience.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST

Before we dive in, let's be crystal clear: **There is no free lunch. This is not going to be easy. Success is not guaranteed.**

Real trading requires real work, discipline, and consistent effort. More importantly, **YOU CAN LOSE YOUR CAPITAL. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING.** This is real money now. You can lose your entire account. Most traders lose money. Trading is extremely risky. This is not guaranteed to make money—it's guaranteed to be risky. Don't be stupid—only trade with money you can afford to lose completely, start with tiny positions, follow your plan strictly, stay disciplined, and understand that you could lose everything you put in.

## Main Content

Your first real trade is a milestone. Here's how to execute it properly and learn from it:

**Pre-Trade Checklist**:

Before placing any order:
- [ ] Reviewed your trading plan
- [ ] Checked emotional state (calm and focused)
- [ ] Identified setup matching your plan
- [ ] Calculated position size (1-2% risk)
- [ ] Set stop loss level
- [ ] Set profit target
- [ ] Checked risk-reward ratio (at least 2:1)
- [ ] No major news events upcoming
- [ ] Confirmed market conditions match your plan

**Executing the Trade**:

**Step 1: Identify the Setup**

Find a trade that matches your plan criteria exactly. Don't force it or convince yourself a mediocre setup is good enough.

Example: "Price broke above 20-day MA, RSI is 55, volume increased 20%, and we're in an uptrend. This matches my plan."

**Step 2: Calculate Position Size**

Based on your risk management:
- Account size: $10,000
- Risk per trade: 1% = $100
- Stop loss distance: $2 per share
- Position size: $100 ÷ $2 = 50 shares

**Step 3: Set Orders**

Place your orders:
- **Entry**: Limit order at your entry price (or market if urgent)
- **Stop Loss**: Set immediately after entry
- **Take Profit**: Set at your target (or use trailing stop)

**Step 4: Confirm Everything**

Double-check:
- Position size is correct
- Stop loss is set
- Profit target is set
- Orders are placed correctly

**During the Trade**:

**What to Do**:
- Trust your plan
- Set price alerts instead of watching screen
- Let the trade play out
- Don't check constantly (causes anxiety)

**What NOT to Do**:
- Move stop loss further away (hoping)
- Close early out of fear
- Add to position (revenge trading)
- Watch every tick (emotional torture)

**Exiting the Trade**:

**Exit When**:
- Profit target is hit (take the win)
- Stop loss is hit (accept the loss)
- Your plan says to exit (time-based, indicator change, etc.)

**Don't Exit When**:
- Scared of small loss (let stop loss work)
- Want more profit (greed—stick to plan)
- Emotional (fear or greed)

**Documenting the Trade**:

Create a trade journal entry:

**Trade Details**:
- Date and time
- Market and instrument
- Entry price
- Exit price
- Position size
- Stop loss level
- Profit target
- Actual profit/loss

**Analysis**:
- Why did you enter? (What setup matched your plan?)
- What happened during the trade?
- Why did you exit? (Target hit, stop hit, plan change?)
- Did you follow your plan? (Yes/No, why?)

**Emotional State**:
- How did you feel entering?
- How did you feel during the trade?
- How did you feel exiting?
- Any emotional decisions made?

**Lessons Learned**:
- What worked well?
- What would you do differently?
- Did your plan work as expected?
- Any plan adjustments needed?

**Post-Trade Review**:

**Immediate Review** (within hours):
- Document everything above
- Note any emotional reactions
- Check if you followed plan

**Weekly Review** (after multiple trades):
- Compare trades to identify patterns
- Are you following your plan consistently?
- What setups are working best?
- What mistakes are you repeating?

**Example Trade Journal Entry**:

```
DATE: [Date]
INSTRUMENT: AAPL
ENTRY: $150.00
EXIT: $153.00 (profit target hit)
POSITION: 50 shares
STOP LOSS: $148.00
PROFIT: $150 (1.5% of account)

SETUP: Price broke above 20-day MA, RSI 55, volume up 25%

FOLLOWED PLAN: Yes, matched all criteria

EMOTIONS: Nervous entering (first trade), anxious during, relieved when target hit

LESSONS: Plan worked. Need to trust it more. Felt better when I stopped watching every tick.

```

**Common First Trade Mistakes**:
- Too large position (emotional)
