# Crypto Trading Platforms: Choosing and Using Platforms

## Learning Objective

Learn about different crypto trading platforms, their features, and how to choose the right one for crypto trading (perps, stocks, memecoins).

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST

Before we dive in, let's be crystal clear: **There is no free lunch. This is not going to be easy. Success is not guaranteed.**

Crypto trading platforms require real work, discipline, and consistent effort. More importantly, **YOU CAN LOSE YOUR CAPITAL. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING.** Having the right platform doesn't guarantee profits. Most crypto traders lose money. Crypto trading is extremely risky. You can lose your entire account. This is not guaranteed to make money—it's guaranteed to be risky. Don't be stupid—only trade with money you can afford to lose completely, learn the platform properly, stay disciplined, and understand that you could lose everything you put in.
