# Project 1: Create Your Personal Trading Plan

## Learning Objective
Hands-on project: Develop a comprehensive trading plan that defines your strategy, risk management, and rules for consistent trading decisions.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - READ THIS FIRST

Before we dive in, let's be crystal clear: **There is no free lunch. This is not going to be easy. Success is not guaranteed.**

Trading plans require real work, discipline, and consistent effort. More importantly, **YOU CAN LOSE YOUR CAPITAL. YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING.** Even with a perfect plan, you can still lose your entire account. Most traders lose money. Trading is extremely risky. This is not guaranteed to make money—it's guaranteed to be risky. Don't be stupid—only trade with money you can afford to lose completely, follow your plan strictly, stay disciplined, and understand that you could lose everything you put in.

A trading plan is your roadmap. Without one, you're gambling. With one, you're trading systematically. Let's build yours:

**Step 1: Define Your Trading Goals**

Answer these questions:
- Why are you trading? (Income, wealth building, learning)
- What's your target return? (Realistic expectations)
- How much time can you commit? (Hours per day/week)
- What's your risk tolerance? (Conservative, moderate, aggressive)
- What's your trading capital? (Amount you can afford to lose)

**Step 2: Choose Your Market and Style**

Based on your goals:
- Which market? (Stocks, forex, crypto, etc.)
- What timeframe? (Day trading, swing trading, position trading)
- What style? (Scalping, momentum, trend following, reversal)

**Step 3: Define Entry Rules**

When will you enter trades? Be specific:
- What chart patterns trigger entries?
- What indicators confirm entries?
- What fundamental factors (if applicable)?
- What market conditions are required?

Example: "Buy when price breaks above 20-day moving average with RSI above 50 and volume increasing, in uptrending market."

**Step 4: Define Exit Rules**

When will you exit? This is critical:
- Profit targets (take profit levels)
- Stop loss levels (risk management)
- Time-based exits (if trade doesn't move)
- Trailing stops (protect profits)

Example: "Exit at 3:1 risk-reward ratio or if stop loss hit. Trail stop to breakeven after 2:1 profit."

**Step 5: Risk Management Rules**

Set strict limits:
- Maximum risk per trade (1-2% of account)
- Maximum positions open at once
- Maximum daily/weekly loss limit
- Maximum position size

Example: "Risk 1% per trade ($100 on $10,000 account). Maximum 3 open positions. Stop trading if down 5% in a week."

**Step 6: Define What NOT to Trade**

Protect yourself:
- Markets to avoid
- Conditions to avoid trading
- Times not to trade
- Emotional states that prohibit trading

Example: "No trading during major news events, no trading when emotional, no trading after 2 consecutive losses."

**Step 7: Create Your Routine**

Daily routine:
- Pre-market: Review plan, check emotional state, analyze markets
- During trading: Follow plan, set alerts, avoid screen watching
- Post-market: Review trades, journal, plan next day

**Step 8: Performance Tracking**

How will you measure success?
- Track win rate
- Track risk-reward ratios
- Track emotional state per trade
- Monthly review of plan effectiveness

**Step 9: Review and Update Schedule**

Plans evolve:
- Weekly review of trades
- Monthly review of plan
- Quarterly assessment of goals
- Adjust based on results

**Step 10: Write It Down**

Document everything:
- Use a notebook or digital document
- Make it detailed and specific
- Keep it accessible
- Refer to it before every trade

**Your Trading Plan Template**:

```

**Common Mistakes**:
