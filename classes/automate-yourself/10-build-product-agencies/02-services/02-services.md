# Defining Your Services

## Learning Objective

Learn how to define clear, valuable AI automation services that solve real problems and generate revenue.

## Main Content

Your services are what you sell. Define them poorly and you can't sell or deliver. Define them well and you have a clear value proposition and delivery process.

**The Service Definition Framework:**

**1. Problem-Focused**

**Start with Problems:**
- What problems do clients have?
- What tasks are repetitive?
- What processes are inefficient?
- What's costing time/money?

**Problem Examples:**
- "We spend 10 hours/week answering the same customer questions"
- "We manually process 100 invoices per week"
- "We can't keep up with content creation"
- "We lose leads because we don't follow up fast enough"

**2. Solution-Focused**

**Define Solutions:**
- How does AI automation solve the problem?
- What tools are used?
- What's the process?
- What's the outcome?

**Solution Examples:**
- "AI chatbot answers customer questions 24/7"
- "AI processes invoices automatically in minutes"
- "AI generates content based on your brand and topics"
- "AI qualifies and follows up with leads automatically"

**3. Outcome-Focused**

**Define Outcomes:**
- What results do clients get?
- What time is saved?
- What money is saved?
- What's the ROI?

**Outcome Examples:**
- "Save 10 hours/week on customer service"
- "Process invoices 10x faster"
- "Publish 5x more content"
- "Increase lead conversion by 30%"
