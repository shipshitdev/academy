Pricing is one of the most important decisions you'll make. Price too low and you attract bad clients and can't sustain. Price too high without experience and you get no clients. Price based on value and market, and you build a sustainable business.

**Costs to Evaluate:**
- Your time (hourly rate)
- AI tool costs (API usage)
- Software subscriptions
- Overhead
- Taxes
- Profit margin

**Minimum Rate Calculation:**
(Desired Annual Income + Expenses + Taxes) / Billable Hours

**Example:**
- Want $100,000/year

- $30,000 taxes
- 1,000 billable hours

**Value Calculation:**
- Client saves $10,000/month
- Your automation costs $2,000/month

**Pricing Communication:**
