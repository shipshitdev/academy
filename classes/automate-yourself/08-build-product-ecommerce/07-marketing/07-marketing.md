Marketing brings customers to your store. Without it, even the best products won't sell. Here are the fundamentals:

**The Marketing Funnel**:

**Awareness**: Make people aware your product exists
**Interest**: Get them interested in what you offer
**Consideration**: Help them evaluate buying
**Purchase**: Convert them to customers
**Retention**: Keep them coming back

**Key Marketing Channels**:

**Facebook & Instagram Ads**:
- Highly targeted (demographics, interests, behaviors)
- Visual platform perfect for product ads
- Start with small budgets ($10-20/day)
- Test multiple ad creatives and audiences

**Google Ads**:
- Capture people actively searching
- Higher intent but more expensive
- Use for specific product searches
- Requires keyword research

**Influencer Marketing**:
- Partner with micro-influencers in your niche
- Authentic promotion to engaged audiences
- Often more cost-effective than ads
- Builds trust through recommendations

**Organic Social Media**:
- Build brand presence on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook
- Show products, behind-the-scenes, customer content
- Engage with your audience
- Free but requires consistent effort

**Email Marketing**:
- Capture emails on your store
- Send promotions, newsletters, abandoned cart emails
- Highest ROI marketing channel
- Build relationships over time

**Content Marketing**:
- Blog posts, videos, guides related to your niche
- Attracts organic traffic
- Builds authority and trust
- Long-term strategy

**Essential Marketing Concepts**:

**Target Audience**: Know exactly who you're selling to. Create detailed customer personas.

**Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: What makes you different? Better price, faster shipping, unique design?

**Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Every piece of marketing needs a clear next step. "Shop Now," "Learn More," "Get 20% Off."

**Retargeting**: Show ads to people who visited but didn't buy. Remind them of products they viewed.

**A/B Testing**: Test different ads, images, copy, and offers to see what works best.

**Marketing Budget**:
- Start: 20-30% of revenue on marketing
- Testing phase: $500-1000 to find winners
- Scaling: Increase as you find profitable ads
- Rule: Customer Lifetime Value should exceed Customer Acquisition Cost by 3x

## Tools

**Common Mistakes**:
