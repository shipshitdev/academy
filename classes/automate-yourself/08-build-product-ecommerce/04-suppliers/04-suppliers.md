# Working with Suppliers (E‑commerce)

## Learning Objective
Learn how to find reliable dropshipping suppliers, evaluate them, and build productive relationships that ensure smooth operations.

## Main Content

Your suppliers are critical partners. They handle fulfillment, shipping, and product quality—everything your customers experience after purchase. Choose wisely.

**Where to Find Suppliers**:

**AliExpress**: Largest marketplace, millions of products, low prices. Best for beginners testing products. Downsides: longer shipping times, communication challenges.

**Spocket**: Pre-vetted suppliers, faster shipping (US/EU), better communication. Higher product costs but better experience.

**Zendrop**: Shopify-integrated, fast US/EU shipping options, vetted suppliers. Good for beginners.

**SaleHoo**: Directory of verified suppliers, includes non-marketplace suppliers. Requires membership but access to better suppliers.

**CJ Dropshipping**: Competitive pricing, warehouses worldwide, good customer service. Growing platform with solid reputation.

**Evaluating Suppliers**:

**Key Criteria**:
- **Shipping Times**: How long to reach your customers? (US: 7-15 days ideal)
- **Product Quality**: Read reviews, order samples, check ratings
- **Communication**: Response time, English proficiency, willingness to help
- **Reliability**: Order fulfillment rate, packaging quality
- **Pricing**: Profit margins after all costs
- **Return Policy**: How they handle returns/refunds

**Testing Process**:
1. Order sample products yourself
2. Test shipping times to your location
