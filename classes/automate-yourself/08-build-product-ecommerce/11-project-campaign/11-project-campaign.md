## Main Content

Time to get customers. Let's launch a Facebook/Instagram ad campaign:

**Step 1: Set Up Tracking**

Before anything:
- Install Meta Pixel on your store
- Set up Google Analytics
- Create Meta Business Manager account
- Verify your domain

**Step 2: Choose Your Product**

Pick one product to test:
- Best images available
- Clear value proposition
- Good profit margins
- Solves a clear problem

**Step 3: Create Ad Creative**

You need:
- **Image/Video**: High quality, shows product benefit
  - Lifestyle shots work best
  - Clear, bright, eye-catching
  - Product is the hero
- **Ad Copy**: 
  - Headline: Benefit-focused, 5-7 words
  - Primary text: Problem → Solution → Call-to-action
  - Keep it conversational and relatable

**Step 4: Set Up Campaign**

In Meta Ads Manager:
- **Objective**: Conversions (purchases)
- **Budget**: Start with $10-20/day
- **Duration**: 5-7 days for testing
- **Audience**: 
  - Start broad (age, gender, interests)
  - Use lookalike audiences if you have customer data
  - Or detailed targeting (interests related to your niche)

**Step 5: Configure Ad Set**

- **Placements**: Start with Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed
- **Bidding**: Lowest cost (let Facebook optimize)
- **Delivery**: Standard (not accelerated)
- **Optimization**: Conversions (purchases)

**Step 6: Launch and Monitor**

Day 1-2: Let ads run, don't make changes
- Monitor spend vs. results
- Check ad frequency (keep under 3)
- Watch for any obvious issues

Day 3-5: Analyze and optimize
- Which ads perform best? (turn off losers)
- Which audiences convert? (narrow focus)
- What times perform best? (adjust schedule)
- Are costs acceptable? (ROAS should be 2-3x minimum)

**Step 7: Scale What Works**

Once you find winners:
- Increase budget gradually (20-50% at a time)
- Duplicate successful ad sets
- Test new creatives similar to winners
- Expand to new audiences

**Key Metrics to Track**:

- **ROAS** (Return on Ad Spend): Revenue ÷ Ad Spend (aim for 2-3x)
- **CPC** (Cost Per Click): Keep under $1-2
- **CTR** (Click-Through Rate): 1%+ is good
- **Conversion Rate**: 1-3% is typical
- **CPA** (Cost Per Acquisition): Should be profitable

**Red Flags**:
- Spending money with no sales after $50-100
- CPC too high ($5+)
- Very low CTR (<0.5%)
- High frequency (ads showing too often)

**Optimization Tips**:
- Test 3-5 ad creatives per campaign
- Test different audiences
- Test different ad copy angles
- Let winners run, pause losers
- Scale gradually (don't double budget immediately)

## Key Takeaways
- Set up tracking (Meta Pixel, Analytics) before launching
- Start with small budgets ($10-20/day) to test
- Create multiple ad creatives and test audiences
- Monitor key metrics: ROAS, CPC, CTR, conversion rate
- Scale only what's profitable, pause losers quickly
