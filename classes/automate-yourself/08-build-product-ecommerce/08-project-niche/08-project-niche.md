## Main Content

Choosing the right niche is your first critical decision. Follow this validation process:

**Step 1: Brainstorm Niches**

List 5-10 niches that interest you. Evaluate:
- Your hobbies and interests
- Problems you've experienced
- Trends you've noticed
- Markets with passionate audiences

Examples: fitness enthusiasts, pet owners, home decor, outdoor enthusiasts, tech gadgets, beauty products, etc.

**Step 2: Evaluate Market Size**

For each niche, research:
- Google Trends: Is interest growing, stable, or declining?
- Social media: Are there active communities? (Reddit, Facebook groups, Instagram)
- Competition: How many stores already exist? (Healthy competition is good)
- Search volume: Are people actively searching? (Google Keyword Planner)

**Step 3: Assess Profit Potential**

Check if products in this niche:
- Have good margins (3-5x markup possible)
- Are lightweight (affordable shipping)
- Solve problems or create emotional connections
- Are priced for impulse purchases ($20-100)

**Step 4: Validate Demand**

Look for proof people are buying:
- Amazon bestsellers in this category
- Successful stores in this niche (use SimilarWeb to check traffic)
- Facebook Ad Library: What ads are running?
- AliExpress: Check bestseller rankings
- Social media: Are influencers promoting products?

**Step 5: Identify Your Angle**

Even in competitive niches, find your unique position:
- Target a specific subset (e.g., "fitness for busy moms" not just "fitness")
- Different pricing strategy
- Unique branding or messaging
- Specific problem you solve better

**Step 6: Final Validation Checklist**

Your niche should have:
- [ ] Growing or stable interest (Google Trends)
- [ ] Active communities and engaged audiences
- [ ] Products with good profit margins
- [ ] Proof of existing demand (sales happening)
- [ ] Room for differentiation

**Red Flags to Avoid**:
- Oversaturated markets with no differentiation opportunity
- Declining trends (Google Trends shows downward)
- No social proof (no one talking about it online)
- Products too expensive or too cheap
- Legal/compliance issues

**Document Your Decision**:
Create a niche document with:

- 5-10 potential products to test
