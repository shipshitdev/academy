## Learning Objective
Learn how to price products for maximum profit while remaining competitive, accounting for all costs and market positioning.

## Main Content

Pricing determines profitability. Price too low and you lose money. Price too high and you lose sales. Here's how to find the sweet spot:

**The Pricing Formula**:

**Total Cost Calculation**:
- Product cost (from supplier)
- Shipping cost (to customer)
- Payment processing fees (2-3% typically)
- Marketing costs (ads, etc.)
- Shopify fees (transaction + monthly)
- Returns/refunds buffer (5-10%)

**Example**:
- Product cost: $10
- Shipping: $3
- Processing fees (3% of $50): $1.50
- Shopify fees: $1.50
- Returns buffer (5%): $2.50
- **Total cost: ~$18.50**

**Markup Strategy**:
- **Minimum markup**: 3x product cost ($10 product = $30 price)
- **Ideal markup**: 4-5x for sustainable margins
- **Premium products**: 5-7x if positioning as high-end

**Pricing Psychology**:

**Charm Pricing**: Prices ending in 9 ($29.99 feels cheaper than $30)
**Anchor Pricing**: Show "was $X, now $Y" to create perceived value
**Bundle Pricing**: Sell multiple items together for better margins
**Tiered Pricing**: Good/Better/Best options guide customers upward

**Market Research**:

**Check Competitors**:
- What are similar stores charging?
- What's the price range in your niche?
- Where can you position yourself?

**Value-Based Pricing**:
Price based on perceived value, not just cost. If your product solves a $100 problem, you can charge $50 even if it costs $10.

**Testing Prices**:
- Start higher, test lower if needed
- A/B test different price points
- Monitor conversion rates at each price
- Adjust based on data

**Pricing Red Flags**:
- Competing solely on price (race to the bottom)
- Ignoring all costs in calculations
- Not accounting for marketing spend
- Setting prices based on guesses

**When to Adjust**:
- Low conversion: May be too high
- High conversion but low profit: Too low
- Competitor changes: Reassess positioning
- Scaling: Increase prices as demand grows

**Profit Margins by Stage**:
- **Testing phase**: Lower margins to test products
- **Scaling phase**: Increase margins as you optimize
- **Established**: Maintain healthy 40-60% margins

**Real Example (Unit Economics)**

Product cost: $12 (supplier)  
Shipping: $3  
Processing/platform fees: ~3% + $0.30 (≈ $1.50 on a $40 order)  
Ad spend per order (target): $12  
Target price: $39.99  

Gross profit ≈ $39.99 − ($12 + $3 + $1.50 + $12) = $11.49  
Gross margin ≈ 28.7%

Improve margin by raising AOV (bundles, upsells), improving conversion, or lowering CPA. Kill products that can't sustain margin.

## Tools

- Simple contribution margin spreadsheet (track price, costs, CPA)
- Shopify reports or GA4 (AOV, conversion rate)
- Post-purchase upsell apps (Zipify OCU, ReConvert)

## Key Takeaways
- Calculate total costs including product, shipping, fees, and marketing
- Use 3-5x markup as a starting point, adjust based on market
- Research competitor pricing to position your products
- Test different price points and adjust based on conversion data
- Price based on value, not just cost
