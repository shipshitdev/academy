# Why E‑commerce (Then Shopify)

## Learning Objective
Understand why e‑commerce is a fast, scalable income stream and when to use Shopify within that strategy.

## Main Content

E‑commerce is a direct path to another income stream. You sell products online with systems that can scale. It's not passive. It requires research, conversion optimization, and operations. Done right, it becomes a durable stream alongside your other income.

**Why E‑commerce Works**
- Direct monetization: sell goods now, not later
- Infinite shelf space: test many products quickly
- Clear feedback loops: conversion, AOV, CAC, LTV
- Automation: fulfillment, customer support, and marketing can be systematized

**Platform Choice**
- Use a managed platform to ship fast
- Avoid building infrastructure yourself
- Focus on product and marketing, not hosting
