## Why Build Products After Distribution

**Distribution First**: You built distribution channels (Classes 2-4). You have an audience. You have traffic. You have authority.

**Products Turn Distribution Into Revenue**: Products monetize your distribution. Products generate income from your audience.

**Products Without Distribution Fail**: If you build products first, you have no audience. No traffic. No customers. Products fail.

**Products With Distribution Succeed**: If you build products after distribution, you have an audience. You have traffic. You have customers. Products succeed.

## Multiple Product Types

**Indie Dev Systems**: Automated software products. Use AI to build faster. Automate everything.

**SaaS Products**: Software as a Service. Scale from 0 to $10k MRR. Focus on product-market fit.

**E‑commerce Shops (Shopify)**: Dropshipping businesses. Use AI for product research and marketing. Focus on conversion.

**Freelancing Businesses**: Service-based businesses. Use AI to write proposals and deliver services. Scale from solo to agency.

**Marketing Agencies**: AI automation agencies. Help businesses automate processes. Use AI tools to deliver value.
