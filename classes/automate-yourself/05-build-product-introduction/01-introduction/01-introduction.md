# Introduction: Build Products That Generate Income

## Learning Objective

Understand how to build products that generate income: indie dev systems, SaaS products, e‑commerce shops (Shopify), freelancing businesses, and marketing agencies.

## Main Content

## Why Build Products

After you have distribution channels (Class 2), build products that generate income. Products turn your distribution into revenue.

**Multiple Product Types**:

- Indie dev systems (automated software products)
- SaaS products (0 to $10k MRR)
- E‑commerce shops (dropshipping businesses, Shopify)
- Freelancing businesses (service products)
- Marketing agencies (AI automation agencies)

Build the product type that fits your skills, distribution channels, and goals.

## The Product Types

### Indie Dev Systems

Build automated software products. Use AI to build faster. Automate everything. Create systems that work without you.

### SaaS Products

Build Software as a Service products. Scale from 0 to $10k MRR. Focus on product-market fit, pricing, and customer acquisition.

### E‑commerce Shops (Shopify)

Build dropshipping businesses. Use AI for product research, store setup (Shopify), and marketing. Focus on conversion and scaling.

### Freelancing Businesses

Build service-based businesses. Use AI to write proposals, manage clients, and deliver services. Scale from solo to agency.

### Marketing Agencies

Build AI automation agencies. Help businesses automate processes. Use AI tools to deliver value. Scale through systems.

## The Process

**For All Product Types**:

1. Validate the idea (or use your distribution channels)
2. Build the product (MVP or minimum viable version)
3. Get first customers (use your distribution)
4. Iterate and improve
5. Scale and automate

Each product type has specific steps. Follow the modules for your chosen type.

## Distribution First

**Critical**: Build distribution first (Class 2). Products without distribution fail.

Use your distribution channels to:

- Validate product ideas
- Get first customers
- Market your products
- Build authority

Don't skip distribution. It's the foundation.

## AI-Powered Product Building

AI accelerates product building:

- Faster development
- Better marketing
- Automated operations
- Systematic scaling

Use AI to build products faster. AI doesn't replace strategy. AI amplifies execution.

## Multiple Streams

Build multiple product types:

- Start with one
- Validate and scale
- Add another type
- Build systems

Don't rely on one product. Build multiple. Diversify income.
