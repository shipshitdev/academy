3. Protect and grow your capital

Each phase builds on the previous one. Don't skip phases.

## Key Concepts Review

**Distribution First**: Products without distribution fail. Build distribution before products.

**Multiple Streams**: Build multiple distribution channels. Build multiple products. Build multiple investments.

**AI-Powered**: Use AI to accelerate everything. AI doesn't replace work. AI amplifies execution.

**Risk Management**: Understand risks. Start small. Only risk what you can afford to lose.

**Execution**: Understanding doesn't guarantee success. Execution does. Execute consistently.
