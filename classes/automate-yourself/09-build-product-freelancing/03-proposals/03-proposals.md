# Proposals: Writing That Wins

## Learning Objective

Learn how to write winning proposals that convert job postings into clients and projects.

## Main Content

Your proposal is your sales pitch. It's how you convince clients to hire you over dozens of other freelancers. A weak proposal means no response. A strong proposal means interviews and projects.

**The Proposal Writing Framework:**

**1. Research First**

Before writing, research:

- The client's business and industry
- Their specific problem or need
- Their goals and objectives
- Previous work they've done
- Their communication style

**2. The Proposal Structure**

**Opening Hook (1-2 sentences):**

- Show you understand their specific problem
- Demonstrate you read their posting
- Create immediate connection

**Understanding (2-3 sentences):**

- Paraphrase their need in your own words
- Show you understand the context
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

**Your Solution (3-4 sentences):**

- Explain your approach
- Show relevant experience
- Connect your skills to their needs

**Why You (2-3 sentences):**

- Highlight relevant experience
- Show specific results if possible
- Differentiate yourself

**Clear Next Steps (1-2 sentences):**

- What happens next
- How to proceed
- Clear call-to-action

**Proposal Templates:**

**Template 1: Discovery Call Approach**

"I understand you're looking for [specific need]. I've helped [similar clients] achieve [specific results] by [your approach].

I'd love to learn more about your specific situation and goals. Are you available for a 15-minute call this week to discuss how I can help?"

**Template 2: Project-Based Approach**

"I read your posting about [specific problem]. I've worked with [similar clients] on [similar projects] and achieved [specific results].

Here's my approach:

- [Step 1 with outcome]
- [Step 2 with outcome]
- [Step 3 with outcome]

I can deliver [specific deliverables] within [timeline] for [price]. Would you like to discuss the details?"

**Template 3: Retainer Approach**

"I understand you need ongoing [service]. I've helped [similar clients] by [approach], resulting in [specific outcomes].

I propose a monthly retainer that includes:

- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

I'm available [X hours] per week at [rate]. Would you like to schedule a call to discuss?"

**AI Tools for Proposal Writing:**

2. **Research client**: Learn about their business

**Follow-Up Strategy:**

If no response after 3-5 days:
