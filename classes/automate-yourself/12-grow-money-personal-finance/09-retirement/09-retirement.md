## Main Content

**Why Retirement Planning Matters:**

**Social Security Isn't Enough**: Average benefit: $1,700/month. Not enough to live comfortably.

**You'll Live Longer**: Life expectancy increasing. Need money for 20-30+ years of retirement.

**Healthcare Costs**: Expensive in retirement. Need savings.

**Inflation**: Money loses value over time. Need more than you think.

**Freedom**: Financial independence = work becomes optional.

**How Much Do You Need for Retirement?**

**The 25x Rule** (Simplest):

**Retirement Savings = Annual Expenses × 25**

**Example**:
- Annual expenses: $60,000
- Retirement savings needed: $60,000 × 25 = $1.5 million

**Why 25x?**: Withdraw 4% per year (safe withdrawal rate). $1.5 million × 4% = $60,000/year.

**The 4% Rule**:

**Concept**: Withdraw 4% of retirement savings in first year, adjust for inflation.

**Example**:
- $1 million saved
- Year 1: Withdraw $40,000
- Year 2: Withdraw $40,000 + inflation
- Continue for 30 years

**Assumptions**:
- 50% stocks, 50% bonds
- 30-year retirement
- 90% success rate

**More Conservative**: 3% withdrawal rate (safer, need more savings).

**Calculating Your Retirement Number:**

**Step 1**: Estimate retirement expenses

**Current Expenses**: $______/month

**Retirement Expenses** (may be different):
- Housing: May be paid off
- Healthcare: Higher
- Travel: May increase
- Other: May decrease

**Estimate**: 70-100% of current expenses

**Step 2**: Calculate annual expenses

**Monthly Expenses**: $______
**Annual Expenses**: $______ × 12 = $______

**Step 3**: Apply 25x rule

**Annual Expenses**: $______
**Retirement Savings Needed**: $______ × 25 = $______

**Example**:
- Current expenses: $5,000/month
- Retirement expenses (80%): $4,000/month
- Annual: $48,000
- Needed: $48,000 × 25 = $1.2 million

**When Can You Retire?**

**Depends On**:
- How much you save
- Investment returns
- When you start
- How much you need

**Retirement Calculators**: Use online calculators to estimate.

**Example Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1: Start at 25**
- Invest $500/month
- 7% average return
- 40 years
- Result: $1.2 million

**Scenario 2: Start at 35**
- Invest $1,000/month
- 7% average return
- 30 years
- Result: $1.2 million

**Starting 10 years earlier = Half the monthly investment needed**
