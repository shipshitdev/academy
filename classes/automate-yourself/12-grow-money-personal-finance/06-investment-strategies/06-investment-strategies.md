**What is Investing?**

Investing is putting your money to work to generate returns over time. Unlike saving (preserving money), investing aims to grow money.

**Why Invest?**

**Beat Inflation**: Cash loses value over time. Investing preserves and grows purchasing power.

**Build Wealth**: Grow money over long term.

**Financial Freedom**: Enough investments to cover expenses.

**Retirement**: Build nest egg for retirement.

**The Power of Investing:**

**$10,000 invested at 7% for 30 years** = $76,000

**$500/month invested at 7% for 30 years** = $566,000

**Time + Consistency + Compound Interest = Wealth**

**Basic Investment Principles:**

**1. Start Early**: Time is your greatest asset.

**2. Invest Consistently**: Regular investing beats timing.

**3. Diversify**: Don't put all eggs in one basket.

**4. Long-Term Focus**: Invest for years, not days.

**5. Low Fees**: Fees eat returns. Keep them low.

**6. Stay Invested**: Don't panic sell during downturns.

**Asset Classes:**

**1. Stocks** (Equities)

**What**: Ownership in companies.

**Risk**: High (volatile, can lose value)

**Return**: High (7-10% average long-term)

**Best For**: Long-term growth, young investors

**2. Bonds**

**What**: Loans to companies/governments.

**Risk**: Low to moderate (more stable)

**Return**: Low to moderate (3-5% average)

**Best For**: Stability, income, older investors

**3. Real Estate**

**What**: Property ownership (direct or REITs)

**Risk**: Moderate to high

**Return**: Moderate to high (varies)

**Best For**: Diversification, income

**4. Cash/Cash Equivalents**

**What**: Savings accounts, money market

**Risk**: Very low (FDIC insured)

**Return**: Very low (barely beats inflation)

**Best For**: Emergency fund, short-term needs

**Asset Allocation:**

**How to Split Your Investments:**

**Age-Based Rule** (Simplest):

**Stocks = 110 - Your Age**

**Example**:
- Age 25: 85% stocks, 15% bonds
- Age 35: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- Age 45: 65% stocks, 35% bonds
- Age 55: 55% stocks, 45% bonds

**Simplified Approach** (For Beginners):

**Age 20-40**: 80-100% stocks, 0-20% bonds
**Age 40-60**: 60-80% stocks, 20-40% bonds
**Age 60+**: 40-60% stocks, 40-60% bonds

**Why More Stocks When Young**:
- More time to recover from losses
- Higher growth potential
- Can afford more risk

**Investment Options:**

**For Beginners** (Recommended):

**1. Index Funds**

**What**: Funds that track market indexes (S&P 500, Total Stock Market)

**Why**:
- Diversified (own hundreds of stocks)
- Low fees (0.03-0.10%)
- Simple (one fund)
- Good returns (match market)

**Examples**:
- **VTSAX** (Vanguard Total Stock Market)
- **VOO** (S&P 500 ETF)
- **SPY** (S&P 500 ETF)
- **VTIAX** (International stocks)

**2. Target-Date Funds**

**What**: Automatically adjust allocation as you age

**Why**:
- One fund does everything
- Automatically rebalances
- Age-appropriate allocation
- Simple

**Examples**:
- **Vanguard Target Retirement 2050**
- **Fidelity Freedom 2050**
- Choose fund matching your retirement year

**3. Robo-Advisors**

**What**: Automated investment management

**Why**:
- Handles everything automatically
- Low fees
- Tax optimization
- Rebalancing

**Examples**:
- **Betterment**: 0.25% fee
- **Wealthfront**: 0.25% fee
- **Vanguard Digital Advisor**: 0.15% fee

**For Advanced**:

**Individual Stocks**: Pick companies (higher risk)

**Sector Funds**: Focus on industries (tech, healthcare)

**International Stocks**: Diversify globally

**Bonds**: Individual bonds or bond funds

**REITs**: Real estate investment trusts

**Start Simple**: Index funds or target-date funds.

**Diversification:**

**Why Diversify**: Reduces risk. If one investment fails, others may succeed.

**How to Diversify**:

**1. Asset Classes**: Stocks, bonds, real estate

**2. Geography**: US, international, emerging markets

**3. Sectors**: Technology, healthcare, finance, etc.

**4. Company Size**: Large cap, mid cap, small cap

**Simplest Diversification**: Total stock market index fund (automatically diversified).

**The Investment Strategy for Beginners:**

**Step 1: Start with Index Funds**

**Choose**:
- **VTSAX** (Total US Stock Market) OR
- **VOO** (S&P 500) OR
- **Target-date fund** (if you want simplicity)

**Step 2: Invest Consistently**

**Automate**:
- Monthly automatic transfers
- Invest same amount regularly
- Do not time the market

**Step 3: Hold Long-Term**

**Timeframe**: 10+ years minimum

**Don't**: Check daily, panic sell, time the market

**Do**: Check quarterly, stay invested, trust process

**Step 4: Rebalance Occasionally**

**When**: Once per year or when allocation drifts 5%+

**How**: Sell winners, buy losers to maintain target allocation

**Or**: Use target-date fund (rebalances automatically)

**Investment Accounts:**

**Tax-Advantaged** (Use First):

**401(k)**:
- Pre-tax contributions
- Employer match (free money)
- Tax-deferred growth
- Limit: $23,000/year

**IRA**:
- **Traditional**: Pre-tax, tax-deferred
- **Roth**: After-tax, tax-free growth (recommended for young)
- Limit: $7,000/year

**HSA** (Health Savings Account):
- Triple tax advantage
- Invest funds
- Use for healthcare or retirement

**Taxable** (After Maxing Above):

**Brokerage Account**:

- But no contribution limits
- Liquid (can sell anytime)

**Investment Order:**

**1. 401(k) up to employer match** (free money)
**2. Max Roth IRA** (tax-free growth)
**3. Max 401(k)** (if you can)
**4. HSA** (if eligible)
**5. Taxable brokerage** (if you have more)

**Common Investment Mistakes:**

**Not Starting**: Waiting for perfect time.

**Solution**: Start now. Time > timing.

**Trying to Time Market**: Waiting for "right" time.

**Solution**: Time in market > timing market. Invest consistently.

**Picking Individual Stocks**: Trying to beat market.

**Solution**: Most fail. Use index funds.

**Panic Selling**: Selling when market drops.

**Solution**: Stay invested. Markets recover. History proves it.

**High Fees**: Paying 1-2% in fees.

**Solution**: Use index funds (0.03-0.10% fees). Fees matter.

**Not Diversifying**: All in one stock or sector.

**Solution**: Diversify. Index funds = automatic diversification.

**Checking Too Often**: Daily checking causes emotional decisions.

**Solution**: Check quarterly. Trust the process.
