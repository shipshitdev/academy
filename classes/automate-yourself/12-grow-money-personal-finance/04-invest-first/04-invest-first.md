# Invest First, Spend the Rest: The Wealth-Building Habit

## Learning Objective

Learn why investing first is the most important financial habit, how to automate it, and how to build wealth systematically by prioritizing investments over spending.

## Main Content

**The Traditional Approach (Wrong):**

**Spend First, Save What's Left**:
- Pay bills
- Buy things
- Spend on wants
- Save/invest what's left (usually nothing)

**Problem**: Most people have nothing left to invest.

**The Right Approach (Invest First):**

**Invest First, Spend the Rest**:
- Invest/save first (automated)
- Pay bills
- Spend the rest

**Why This Works**: You prioritize wealth building. Spending adjusts automatically.

**Why Investing First Matters:**

**Time is Your Greatest Asset**: The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow.

**Example**:
- **Age 25**: Invest $500/month for 40 years at 7% = $1.2 million
- **Age 35**: Invest $500/month for 30 years at 7% = $566,000
- **Age 45**: Invest $500/month for 20 years at 7% = $260,000

**Starting 10 years earlier = 2x more money**

**Habit Formation**: Investing first becomes automatic. You don't miss the money.

**Forces Discipline**: Limited money forces smarter spending decisions.

**How Much to Invest First:**

**The 20% Rule**: Invest 20% of your income.

**If You Can't Do 20%**:
- Start with 10%
- Increase by 1% every 3 months
- Build to 20% over time

**If You Can Do More**:
- 25-30% for faster wealth building
- 50%+ if you want to retire early (FIRE movement)

**The Math**:

**At $5,000/month income**:
- 10% = $500/month = $6,000/year
- 20% = $1,000/month = $12,000/year
- 30% = $1,500/month = $18,000/year

**Where to Invest First:**

**Priority 1: Emergency Fund** (3-6 months expenses)

**Before Investing**: Build emergency fund first.

**Why**: Protects against unexpected expenses without touching investments.

**How Much**: 3-6 months of essential expenses.

**Where**: High-yield savings account (easily accessible).

**Priority 2: Employer Retirement Match** (Free Money)

**If Employer Matches**: Contribute enough to get full match.

**Example**: Employer matches 50% up to 6% of salary.
- You contribute 6% = Employer contributes 3% = 9% total
- This is free money. Never miss it.

**Priority 3: Tax-Advantaged Retirement Accounts**

**401(k) or 403(b)** (if employer offers):
- Pre-tax contributions
- Tax-deferred growth
- Employer match (if available)
- Limit: $23,000/year (2024)

**IRA** (Individual Retirement Account):
- Traditional IRA: Pre-tax, tax-deferred
- Roth IRA: After-tax, tax-free growth
- Limit: $7,000/year (2024)

**Priority 4: Taxable Investment Accounts**

**After maxing retirement accounts**:
- Brokerage account
- Index funds
- ETFs
- Individual stocks (if you want)

**The Investment Order:**

**Step 1**: Emergency fund (3-6 months)
**Step 2**: Employer match (free money)
**Step 3**: Max Roth IRA (tax-free growth)
**Step 4**: Max 401(k) (if available)
**Step 5**: Taxable investments

**Automating Your Investments:**

**Why Automate**:
- Removes temptation to skip
- Invests consistently
- Takes emotions out
- Builds habit

**How to Automate:**

**401(k)**:
- Set up automatic payroll deduction
- Set percentage of salary
- Increase annually

**IRA**:
- Set up automatic transfer from bank
- Schedule for payday
- Invest same day

**Brokerage**:
- Automatic transfer to investment account
- Auto-invest in index funds
- Set and forget

**Example Setup**:

**Payday (Bi-weekly, $2,500)**:
- $500 automatically to 401(k)
- $250 automatically to Roth IRA
- $750 automatically to emergency fund (until complete)
- $1,000 remaining for spending

**You never see the investment money. It's automatic.**

**What to Invest In:**

**For Beginners** (Recommended):

**Index Funds**:
- S&P 500 index fund (VOO, SPY)
- Total stock market fund (VTSAX, VTI)
- Diversified, low fees, simple

**Target-Date Funds**:
- Automatically adjust as you age
- Diversified (stocks, bonds)
- Simple (one fund)

**Why Index Funds**:
- Diversified (own hundreds of stocks)
- Low fees
- Historically good returns (7-10% average)
- Simple (no stock picking)

**For Advanced**:
- Individual stocks
- Sector funds
- Real estate (REITs)
- Bonds
- International stocks

**Start Simple**: Index funds. Add complexity later if needed.

**The Power of Consistency:**

**Example**: Investing $500/month for 30 years at 7% average return.

**Year 1**: $6,000 invested = $6,420
**Year 5**: $30,000 invested = $36,000
**Year 10**: $60,000 invested = $86,000
**Year 20**: $120,000 invested = $260,000
**Year 30**: $180,000 invested = $566,000

**You invested $180,000. It grew to $566,000. That's the power of compound interest.**

**Common Investing Mistakes:**

**Not Starting**: Waiting for perfect time or more money.

**Solution**: Start now with whatever you can. Time is more important than amount.

**Not Automating**: Investing manually, skipping months.

**Solution**: Automate everything. Set and forget.

**Trying to Time Market**: Waiting for "right" time to invest.

**Solution**: Time in market > timing market. Invest consistently.

**Picking Individual Stocks**: Trying to beat market.

**Solution**: Most people fail. Use index funds.

**Panic Selling**: Selling when market drops.

**Solution**: Stay invested. Market recovers. Time is your friend.

**High Fees**: Paying high investment fees.

**Solution**: Use low-cost index funds (fees <0.1%).
