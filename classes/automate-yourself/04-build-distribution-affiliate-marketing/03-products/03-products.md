# Product Research

## Learning Objective

Learn how to find and evaluate affiliate products that align with your niche, offer good commissions, and provide value to your audience.

## Main Content

Your affiliate products are the foundation of your business. Promote the wrong products and you lose trust, get low conversions, and damage your reputation. Promote the right products and you earn commissions while helping your audience.

**The Product Research Framework:**

**1. Product Quality**

**Why It Matters:**
- You're putting your reputation on the line
- Low-quality products hurt conversions
- Bad products damage trust
- You want repeat customers

**How to Evaluate:**
- Read reviews (Amazon, Trustpilot, etc.)
- Test products yourself when possible
- Check ratings and feedback
- Research company reputation
- Look for red flags

**Red Flags:**
- Consistently bad reviews
- Poor customer service
- Shady business practices
- High refund rates
- No customer support

**2. Commission Rates**

**Commission Types:**
- **Percentage**: 5-50% of sale price
- **Fixed**: $X per sale regardless of price
- **Recurring**: Ongoing commissions (SaaS, subscriptions)

**What to Look For:**
- **Digital Products**: 30-75% (courses, software)
- **Physical Products**: 5-15% (Amazon, e-commerce)
- **Services**: 10-30% (SaaS, tools)
- **High-Ticket**: Lower % but higher dollar amount

**3. Cookie Duration**

**What It Means:**
- How long you get credit for a sale
- Starts when someone clicks your link
- Longer is better (more time to convert)

**Typical Durations:**
- **Amazon**: 24 hours
- **ClickBank**: 60 days
- **ShareASale**: 30-90 days
- **Direct Programs**: 30-365 days

**4. Product Price**

**Price Considerations:**
- Higher price = higher commission (usually)
- But also harder to convert
- Define your audience's budget
- Balance price with conversion rate

**Price Ranges:**
- **Low**: $10-$50 (impulse buys, easier to convert)
- **Medium**: $50-$200 (considered purchases)
- **High**: $200+ (requires more trust and education)

**5. Audience Alignment**

**Critical Factor:**
- Product must match your audience
- Must solve their problems
- Must fit their needs and budget
- Must align with your content
