## Learning Objective

Learn how to build referral programs and affiliate marketing systems that turn customers and partners into your sales force, scaling growth with minimal acquisition cost.

## Main Content

**Why Referral and Affiliate Marketing Works:**

**Benefits**:
- **Low CAC**: Referrals cost 5-10x less than paid ads
- **High Quality**: Referred customers are better (higher LTV, lower churn)
- **Scalable**: Leverages other people's networks
- **Trust**: People trust recommendations from friends/experts
- **Organic Growth**: Multiplies your reach without you doing the work

**The Math**:
- **Paid Ads**: $100 CAC, 10% churn, 12-month LTV = $1,000
- **Referrals**: $10 CAC (commission), 5% churn, 18-month LTV = $1,800

**Referrals are cheaper AND better customers.**

**Referral Programs vs. Affiliate Programs:**

**Referral Programs**:
- Existing customers refer new customers
- Usually smaller rewards (discount, credit, cash)
- Built into product (in-app)
- Focus: Customer retention and growth

**Affiliate Programs**:
- External partners promote your product
- Usually larger commissions (20-40%)
- Separate program/portal
- Focus: New customer acquisition

**You need both. They serve different purposes.**

**Building a Referral Program:**

**Step 1: Define Structure**

**Reward Options**:
- **Discount**: 20% off for both referrer and referee
- **Credit**: $50 credit for referrer, $25 for referee
- **Cash**: $100 cash for referrer
- **Free Month**: Free month for both
- **Tier-Based**: More rewards for more referrals

**Best Practice**: Reward both referrer and referee (increases participation).

**Step 2: Make It Easy**

**Referral Mechanisms**:
- **Unique Link**: Each customer gets unique referral link
- **In-App**: Built into product (dashboard, settings)
- **Email**: Easy share button in emails
- **Social Sharing**: One-click share to social media
- **Copy Link**: Simple copy-paste link

**The Friction Test**: If it takes more than 30 seconds, it's too hard.

**Step 3: Track Everything**

**Tracking System**:
- **Unique Codes**: Each customer gets unique code
- **Attribution**: Track who referred whom
- **Conversion**: Track referral → signup → paid
- **Analytics**: Measure referral rate, conversion rate, LTV

**Tools**: Built-in (Stripe, Recurly), Third-party (ReferralCandy, Friendbuy), Custom (your own system)

**Step 4: Promote Actively**

**Promotion Channels**:
- **Welcome Email**: Mention referral program in welcome email
- **In-App**: Show referral program in dashboard
- **Email Campaigns**: Send referral emails to active customers
- **Social Media**: Promote on your channels
- **Customer Success**: Mention during support interactions

**The Rule**: If customers don't know about it, they won't use it.
