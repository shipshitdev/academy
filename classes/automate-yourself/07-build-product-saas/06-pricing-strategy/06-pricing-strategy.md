## Learning Objective

Learn how to price your product or service to maximize revenue, balance value perception, and grow from $0 to $10k MRR efficiently.

## Main Content

**Why Pricing Matters:**

Pricing is the single biggest lever for revenue. A 10% price increase with no churn increase = 10% more revenue. Pricing affects:
- Revenue per customer
- Customer acquisition (higher prices = harder to sell)
- Customer perception (price signals quality)
- Your ability to grow (need revenue to invest)

**The Pricing Paradox**: Price too low and you can't afford to grow. Price too high and you can't get customers.

**Pricing Models:**

**1. One-Time Payment**
- Customer pays once
- Good for: Products, courses, tools
- Challenge: No recurring revenue

**2. Subscription (Monthly/Annual)**
- Recurring revenue (best for MRR)
- Good for: SaaS, services, content
- Challenge: Need to provide ongoing value

**3. Usage-Based**
- Pay per use (per transaction, per API call, etc.)
- Good for: Marketplaces, APIs, platforms
- Challenge: Revenue is variable

**4. Freemium**
- Free tier + paid tier
- Good for: Products with network effects
- Challenge: Need to convert free to paid

**5. Tiered Pricing**
- Multiple price points (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Good for: Serving different customer segments
- Challenge: Need to justify differences

**For $10k MRR Goal**: Subscription is usually best (predictable recurring revenue).

**How to Price Your Product:**

**Method 1: Value-Based Pricing**

**Principle**: Price based on value delivered, not cost to produce.

**Steps**:
1. Calculate value you provide (time saved, money saved, revenue generated)
2. Price at 10-20% of value delivered
3. Example: Save customer $1,000/month → Price at $100-200/month

**Example**:
- Task management tool saves 10 hours/week
- Hourly rate: $50
- Value: $500/week = $2,000/month
- Price: $200/month (10% of value)

**Method 2: Competitor-Based Pricing**

**Principle**: Price relative to competitors.

**Steps**:
1. Research competitor pricing
2. Position based on your value prop
3. If better: Price higher. If newer: Price lower.

**Example**:
- Competitor A: $50/month
- Competitor B: $100/month
- You're better than A, newer than B
- Price: $75/month (middle ground)

**Method 3: Cost-Plus Pricing**

**Principle**: Price = Cost + Desired Margin

**Steps**:
1. Calculate costs (hosting, tools, your time)
2. Add desired margin (3-5x for SaaS)
3. Price = Cost × Margin Multiple

**Example**:
- Monthly costs: $20 (hosting, tools)
- Desired margin: 5x
- Price: $20 × 5 = $100/month

**Method 4: Market Research Pricing**

**Principle**: Test what customers will pay.

**Steps**:
1. Survey potential customers
2. Ask: "What would you pay for this?"
3. Test different price points
4. Use willingness-to-pay data

**The Best Approach**: Combine all methods, then test.

**Pricing Psychology:**

**Charm Pricing**: Prices ending in 9 ($29, $99, $299)
- Feels cheaper than round numbers
- Works for most products

**Anchor Pricing**: Show "was $X, now $Y"
- Creates perceived value
- Use for discounts/launches

**Decoy Pricing**: Add a middle option to make target option attractive
- Example: $29 Basic, $99 Pro (target), $299 Enterprise
- Makes Pro look like best value

**Tiered Pricing Best Practices:**

**Three Tiers** (Most Common):
- **Starter**: For individuals/small users ($29)
- **Professional**: For growing businesses ($99) - Your target
- **Enterprise**: For large companies ($299+)

**Pricing Differences**:
- 3-4x between tiers
- Clear value differences
- Feature limits (not just "more")

**Example SaaS Pricing**:

**Starter - $29/month**
- Up to 5 users
- Basic features
- Email support

**Professional - $99/month** (Most Popular)
- Up to 25 users
- All features
- Priority support
- Analytics

**Enterprise - $299/month**
- Unlimited users
- Custom features
- Dedicated support
- API access

**Testing Your Pricing:**

**A/B Testing**:
- Test different prices with different audiences
- Measure conversion rate, not just revenue
- Test one variable at a time

**The Price Sensitivity Test**:
- Offer product at different prices to different segments
- Measure conversion at each price
- Find optimal price point

**The Van Westendorp Method**:
- "At what price would this be too expensive?"
- "At what price would this be too cheap?"
- "At what price would this be expensive but still buy?"
- "At what price would this be a bargain?"

**Pricing for Growth: $0 to $10k MRR**

**Stage 1: $0-$1k MRR** (Validation)
- Price: Lower to get first customers
- Focus: Validation, not revenue
- Example: $29-49/month

**Stage 2: $1k-$5k MRR** (Early Growth)
- Price: Increase to sustainable level
- Focus: Prove value, build case studies
- Example: $49-99/month

**Stage 3: $5k-$10k MRR** (Scaling)
- Price: Optimize for revenue
- Focus: Maximize LTV, reduce churn
- Example: $79-149/month

**Common Pricing Mistakes:**

**Pricing Too Low**:
- Can't afford to grow
- Signals low quality
- Attracts wrong customers
- Hard to raise later

**Solution**: Start higher, discount if needed.

**Pricing Too High**:
- Can't get customers
- Sales cycles too long
- High churn

**Solution**: Lower price, prove value, raise later.

**Not Testing**:
- Assuming you know the right price
- Never changing price

**Solution**: Test constantly. Prices aren't permanent.

**Ignoring Competitors**:
- Pricing in isolation
- Not understanding market

**Solution**: Research competitors, understand positioning.

**Complex Pricing**:
- Too many tiers
- Confusing features
- Hard to understand

**Solution**: Keep it simple. 3 tiers max.

**When to Raise Prices:**

**Signs It's Time**:
- High demand (can't keep up)
- Low churn (customers love it)
- Competitors charge more
- You're adding value
- Long sales cycles (price too low)

**How to Raise Prices**:
- **Grandfather**: Existing customers keep old price
- **Announce**: Give 30-60 days notice
- **Add Value**: Introduce new features with price increase
- **Communicate**: Explain why (more value, better service)

**AI Tools for Pricing:**

**Market Research**:
- AI analyzes competitor pricing
- Identifies pricing trends
- Suggests optimal price points

**A/B Testing**:
- AI optimizes price testing
- Predicts conversion at different prices
- Identifies optimal price points

**Customer Analysis**:
- AI analyzes willingness to pay
- Identifies price-sensitive segments
- Predicts churn at different prices

**The $10k MRR Math:**

**If $99/month pricing**:
- Need: 101 customers ($99 × 101 = $9,999)
- With churn: ~110-120 customers (account for 10-15% churn)

**If $49/month pricing**:
- Need: 204 customers ($49 × 204 = $9,996)
- With churn: ~230-250 customers

**If $149/month pricing**:
- Need: 67 customers ($149 × 67 = $9,983)
- With churn: ~75-80 customers

**Higher prices = Fewer customers needed = Faster to $10k MRR**

## Key Takeaways

- Pricing is the biggest lever for revenue—test it constantly
- Use value-based pricing when possible (10-20% of value delivered)
- Research competitors but don't just copy—position based on your value
- Test pricing with A/B tests and customer research
- Start higher, you can always lower (harder to raise)
- For $10k MRR: Higher prices = fewer customers needed
- Use tiered pricing (3 tiers) to serve different segments
- Raise prices when you have high demand and low churn
