# Project 2: Build Your MVP

## Learning Objective

Hands-on project: Build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) using the methods and tools you've learned, getting it to users in 4-8 weeks.

## Main Content

**Project Overview:**

This project guides you through building your MVP from start to finish. By the end, you'll have a working product that solves the core problem and is ready for your first users.

**Prerequisites:**

**Before Starting**:
- You've validated your idea (Project 1)
- You understand the problem deeply
- You know who your customers are
- You have a clear solution approach

**Step 1: Define MVP Scope**

**The MVP Rule**: Build the minimum to solve the core problem.

**What to Include**:
- ONE core feature that solves the main problem
- Basic functionality that works
- Essential user flow (signup → use → get value)

**What to Exclude**:
- Nice-to-have features
- Advanced functionality
- Multiple features
- Polish and perfection

**Example**:

**For Task Management App**:
- ✅ Core: Create and view tasks
- ❌ Not MVP: Editing, deleting, categories, due dates, sharing

**For SaaS Tool**:
- ✅ Core: One main feature that solves problem
- ❌ Not MVP: Dashboard, analytics, integrations, mobile app

**Write Down Your MVP Scope**:

**What You're Building**:
- [ ] Core feature: _______________
- [ ] Who it's for: _______________
- [ ] What problem it solves: _______________
- [ ] How users will use it: _______________

**Step 2: Choose Your MVP Type**

**Based on Your Skills**:

**If Non-Technical**:
- **No-Code MVP**: Use Bubble, Webflow, Zapier
- **Concierge MVP**: Do it manually first
- **Landing Page + Manual**: Sell, then build

**If Technical**:
- **Coded MVP**: Build with your preferred stack
- **No-Code + Code**: Hybrid approach

**If You Have Budget**:
- Hire developer (Upwork, Toptal)
- Use AI-assisted development tools

**Decision Matrix**:

**No-Code**:
- Pros: Fast, no coding, easy to change
- Cons: Limited flexibility, scaling concerns
- Best for: Testing, validating, non-technical founders

**Coded**:
- Pros: Full control, scalable, professional
- Cons: Slower, requires coding skills
- Best for: Technical founders, complex products

**Concierge**:
- Pros: Learn deeply, no tech needed
- Cons: Doesn't scale, manual work
- Best for: Understanding needs before building

**Step 3: Choose Your Tech Stack (If Coded)**

**For Web Apps**:

**Frontend**:
- React, Vue, or Next.js
- Use AI tools (GitHub Copilot) for faster development

**Backend**:
- Node.js, Python, or Ruby
- Firebase, Supabase (backend-as-a-service)

**Database**:
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Supabase, Firebase (managed)

**Hosting**:
- Vercel, Netlify (frontend)
- Railway, Render (backend)
- Heroku (simple deployment)

**Recommendation**: Start simple. Use managed services (Supabase, Firebase) to move faster.

**Step 4: Design Your MVP**

**Keep It Simple**:

**Design Principles**:
- **Clarity**: Users understand what to do
- **Simplicity**: Remove everything unnecessary
- **Speed**: Fast loading, fast actions
- **Mobile**: Works on phones (responsive)

**Design Tools**:
- **Figma**: Free, professional

**Common MVP Mistakes:**

**Overbuilding**: Adding too many features.

**Solution**: Cut more. MVP should feel incomplete.

**Perfectionism**: Waiting for it to be perfect.

**Solution**: Launch when it barely works. Iterate after.

**Not Testing**: Launching without testing.

**Solution**: Test with yourself and beta users first.

**Ignoring Mobile**: Desktop-only MVP.

**Solution**: Mobile-first design. Most users on phones.

**Not Getting Users**: Building but not launching.

**Solution**: Launch to real users immediately.

**Timeline:**

**Week 1-2**: Design and planning
- Define scope
- Choose approach
- Design interface
- Set up tools

**Week 3-6**: Build
- Build core feature
- Create landing page
- Set up analytics
- Test internally

**Week 7-8**: Beta test and launch
- Beta test with 5-10 users
- Fix critical bugs
- Launch to public
- Collect feedback

**Success Criteria:**

**Your MVP is Ready When**:
- Solves core problem
- Works for main use case
- Beta testers can use it
- No critical bugs
- Ready for first real customers

**Next Steps After MVP:**

**Week 1**: Fix bugs, respond to feedback

**Week 2-4**: Add most-requested features

**Month 2**: Focus on retention

**Month 3**: Focus on growth

## Key Takeaways

- MVP = Minimum to solve core problem, nothing more
- Choose approach based on skills (no-code vs. coded)
- Build fast (4-8 weeks), iterate after launch
- Test with yourself and beta users before public launch
- Use AI tools to build faster
- Mobile-first design is essential
- Launch when it barely works, not when it's perfect
- Focus on one core feature, exclude everything else
