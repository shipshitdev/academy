# MVP Development: Build Your Minimum Viable Product

## Learning Objective

Learn how to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—the simplest version of your product that solves the core problem and validates your business model.

## Main Content

**What is an MVP?**

A Minimum Viable Product is the simplest version of your product that:
- Solves the core problem
- Provides value to early customers
- Tests your key assumptions
- Can be built quickly (weeks, not months)

**The MVP Mindset**: Build the minimum, learn the maximum.

**MVP Principles:**

**1. Solve One Core Problem**: Do not attempt to solve everything. Pick the most important problem and solve it well.

**2. Build Fast**: Your MVP should take weeks, not months. Speed matters more than perfection.

**3. Learn First**: The goal is learning, not perfection. Your MVP will be "bad," and that's okay.

**4. Manual First**: Automate later. Start with manual processes, then automate what works.

**5. Get It to Users**: An MVP that nobody uses is worthless. Get it to real users quickly.

**Types of MVPs:**

**1. Concierge MVP**: You manually do what the product will automate.

**Example**: Before building a meal-planning app, manually create meal plans for 10 customers. Learn what they need, then build.

**Use When**: You need to deeply understand customer needs before building.

**2. Wizard of Oz MVP**: Appears automated but runs manually behind the scenes.

**Example**: A chatbot that's actually you responding. Learn what people ask, then build AI.

**Use When**: You need to test demand and user behavior before building technology.

**Real Example**: Dropbox validated demand with a simple explainer video before building the full product—collecting signups to prove interest. Source: founder interviews and public case studies.

**3. Landing Page MVP**: A landing page that describes your product and collects signups.

**Example**: Create a landing page, drive traffic, measure interest before building.

**Use When**: You need to validate demand before building anything.

**4. Single-Feature MVP**: One core feature, nothing else.

**Example**: A task app that only creates tasks (no editing, deleting, sharing).

**Use When**: You have a clear core feature to test.

**5. No-Code MVP**: Build using no-code tools (Bubble, Webflow, Zapier).

**Example**: A marketplace built with Bubble, a SaaS with Webflow + Zapier.

**Use When**: You need to test quickly without coding.

**6. Coded MVP**: Build with code (if you have technical skills).

**Example**: A simple web app or mobile app.

**Use When**: You have coding skills or a co-founder who codes.

**AI-Powered MVP Development:**

**No-Code + AI**:
- Use AI to generate code for no-code platforms
- Use AI to create content, copy, and designs
- Use AI chatbots for customer support (early MVP)

**Content Generation**:
- AI generates product descriptions, landing page copy
- AI creates marketing materials
- AI generates user documentation

**Automation**:
- AI automates repetitive tasks
- AI handles customer onboarding
- AI manages basic customer service

**Development Tools**:
- **No-Code**: Bubble, Webflow, Zapier, Airtable, Softr
- **Low-Code**: Retool, Adalo, Glide
- **AI-Assisted Coding**: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, ChatGPT for code
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase, Firebase, Xano

**The MVP Development Process:**

**Step 1: Define Your MVP Scope**

**What's the ONE core feature?**

Ask yourself:
- What's the minimum to solve the problem?
- What can you cut that isn't essential?
- What can you do manually instead of building?

**Example**: For a task management app:
- Core: Create tasks
- Not MVP: Editing, deleting, sharing, categories, due dates

**Step 2: Choose Your MVP Type**

Based on:
- Your skills (technical vs. non-technical)
- Your timeline (weeks vs. months)
- Your validation needs (concierge vs. coded)
- Your resources (time, money, team)

**Step 3: Build It**

**If No-Code**:
- Choose platform (Bubble, Webflow, etc.)
- Use AI to generate copy and content
- Build core functionality
- Test with yourself first

**If Coded**:
- Choose tech stack (simple is better)
- Use AI to help with code
- Build core feature only
- Deploy quickly (Vercel, Netlify for web)

**Step 4: Get It to Users**

**Who are your first 5-10 users?**
- People from your validation interviews
- Friends/family (but be honest about feedback)
- Beta testers from communities
- Your own network

**Step 5: Collect Feedback**

**What to Measure**:
- Do people use it? (Usage metrics)
- Do they come back? (Retention)
- What do they struggle with? (Friction points)
- What do they love? (Value points)
- Would they pay? (Willingness to pay)

**Step 6: Iterate**

**Build → Measure → Learn → Repeat**

- Fix critical bugs immediately
- Add features based on feedback
- Remove features that aren't used
- Focus on what creates value

**Common MVP Mistakes:**

**Overbuilding**: Adding features nobody asked for.

**Solution**: Start smaller. Cut more.

**Perfectionism**: Waiting for it to be "ready."

**Solution**: Launch when it's barely usable.

**Not Getting Users**: Building in isolation.

**Solution**: Get users from day one.

**Ignoring Feedback**: Building what you want, not what users need.

**Solution**: Listen to users. They're always right.

**Building Technology First**: Building before validating demand.

**Solution**: Validate first (previous module).

**The MVP Checklist:**

Before launching your MVP:
- [ ] Solves one core problem well
- [ ] Can be built in 4-8 weeks
- [ ] Has at least 5 beta users ready
- [ ] Has way to collect feedback
- [ ] Has basic analytics/metrics
- [ ] Works on main use case (even if buggy)
- [ ] You're ready to iterate based on feedback

**After MVP Launch:**

**Week 1-2**: Fix critical bugs, respond to all feedback

**Week 3-4**: Add most-requested features, improve core experience

**Month 2**: Focus on retention—why do people come back?

**Month 3**: Focus on growth—how do you get more users?

**When to Pivot**:
- Users don't use it after trying
- Users don't come back
- Nobody will pay
- Problem isn't as painful as you thought

**When to Continue**:
- Users actively use it
- Users come back regularly
- Users say they'd pay
- Users refer others

## Key Takeaways

- MVP is the simplest version that solves the core problem
- Build fast (weeks, not months) and learn from users
- Choose MVP type based on skills, timeline, and validation needs
- Use AI and no-code tools to build faster
- Get MVP to users immediately—don't wait for perfection
- Focus on one core feature, do it manually if needed
- Iterate based on feedback, not assumptions

## Next Steps

Once you have an MVP, you need to find product-market fit. The next module covers how to iterate your product until it resonates with your market.

## Action Items

- Define your MVP scope (one core feature)
- Choose your MVP type (concierge, no-code, coded)
