## Learning Objective

Learn how to scale your startup from your first customers to $10k Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by building systems, optimizing channels, and automating operations.

## Main Content

**The Scaling Challenge:**

Getting to $10k MRR is different from getting your first 10 customers. You can't:
- Personally sell to every customer
- Manually onboard everyone
- Handle all support yourself
- Track everything manually

**The Solution**: Build systems that scale. Automate what you can. Focus on what only you can do.

**The $10k MRR Math:**

**At $99/month pricing**:
- Need: 101 customers ($99 × 101 = $9,999)
- With 10% churn: ~110-120 customers needed

**At $49/month pricing**:
- Need: 204 customers ($49 × 204 = $9,996)
- With 10% churn: ~230-250 customers needed

**At $149/month pricing**:
- Need: 67 customers ($149 × 67 = $9,983)
- With 10% churn: ~75-80 customers needed

**Higher prices = Fewer customers needed = Faster to $10k MRR**

**The Scaling Journey:**

**Stage 1: $1k-$3k MRR** (10-30 customers)
- Focus: Product-market fit, customer feedback
- Channels: Manual outreach, content marketing (starting)
- Operations: Mostly manual, basic automation

**Stage 2: $3k-$7k MRR** (30-70 customers)
- Focus: Find repeatable channels, optimize conversion
- Channels: Scale what works, test new channels
- Operations: Automate key processes

**Stage 3: $7k-$10k MRR** (70-100 customers)
- Focus: Scale profitable channels, optimize operations
- Channels: Double down on winners, expand
- Operations: Full automation, systems in place
