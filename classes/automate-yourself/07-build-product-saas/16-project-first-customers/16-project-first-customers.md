**Pricing Strategy for First 10:**

**Options**:

**Tracking Your Progress:**

**Create Spreadsheet**:

**Columns**:
- Customer name
- Source (network, warm, cold)
- Contact date
- Response date
- Demo date
- Close date
- Revenue
- Status (lead, demo, closed, lost)
- Notes

**Metrics to Track**:
- Response rate (% who respond)
- Demo rate (% who do demo)
- Close rate (% who buy)
- Average time to close
- Revenue from first 10

**Goal**: Track everything. Learn what works.

**Common Mistakes:**

**Not Asking for the Sale**: Being too shy.

**Solution**: Ask directly. Be clear about what you want.

**Giving Up Too Early**: Not following up.

**Solution**: Follow up 3-5 times. Most sales take multiple touches.

**Not Listening**: Talking too much.

**Solution**: Ask questions. Listen to needs. Then sell.

**Not Personalizing**: Generic outreach.

**Solution**: Personalize every message. Mention why you're reaching out.

**Not Following Up**: Assuming "no" means "no forever."

**Solution**: Follow up. People's situations change.

**Timeline:**

**Week 1**: Personal network (reach out to 20 people, goal: 3 customers)

**Week 2**: Warm outreach (reach out to 50 people, goal: 4 customers)

**Week 3-4**: Cold outreach (reach out to 100+ people, goal: 3 customers)

**Total**: 4 weeks to get first 10 customers

**Success Criteria:**

**You're Successful When**:
- You have 10 paying customers
- You've learned what works (sales, marketing)
- You have testimonials/case studies
- You understand customer needs
- You can repeat the process

**After First 10 Customers:**

**What to Do**:
1. **Get Feedback**: Ask what they love, what they need
2. **Get Testimonials**: Ask for reviews, quotes
3. **Create Case Studies**: Document success stories
4. **Improve Product**: Add features they request
5. **Scale Process**: Systematize what worked

**Next Milestone**: Get to 50 customers, then 100, then scale to $10k MRR.
