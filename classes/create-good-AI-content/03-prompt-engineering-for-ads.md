## The Critical Elements

### 1. Specificity

**Vague**: "A product photo"
**Specific**: "Professional product photography of [product] on white background, studio lighting, showing [key features]"

**More specific = better results**. AI models need details.

### 2. Conversion Elements

Always include:
- **Clear focus**: What's the main subject?
- **Professional quality**: "Commercial photography", "studio lighting", "professional quality"
- **Ad optimization**: "Suitable for advertisement", "ad-ready", "commercial use"
- **Brand alignment**: Style, colors, mood that matches your brand

### 3. Visual Style

Specify:
- Photography style: "Professional product photography", "lifestyle photography", "cinematic"
- Lighting: "Studio lighting", "natural lighting", "golden hour"
- Composition: "Product-focused", "lifestyle scene", "hero shot"
- Colors: "Vibrant colors", "minimalist", "warm tones"

### 4. Technical Quality

Always include:
- "High resolution"
- "Sharp focus"
- "Professional quality"
- "Commercial photography"

## Prompt Variations for A/B Testing

**Base Prompt**:
```
Professional product photography of a fitness tracker, studio lighting, white background, product-focused, commercial quality
```

**Variation 1: Lifestyle Integration**

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Vague**
- "A good product photo" → Be specific about style, lighting, composition

**Mistake 2: Missing Conversion Elements**
- Forgetting "commercial quality" or "ad-ready" → Always include

**Mistake 3: No Audience Focus**
- Generic prompts → Include target audience context

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Brand Style**
- Random aesthetic → Match your brand colors, style, mood

**Mistake 5: Single Prompt**
- One prompt, one result → Create variations for testing

## Key Takeaways

- Every prompt needs: product, audience, value prop, style, CTA, conversion elements
- Be specific: vague prompts = mediocre results
- Include conversion elements: "commercial quality", "ad-ready", "professional"
- Test variations: A/B test different prompts, let data decide
- Use genfeed.ai templates: start with proven structures, customize from there
- Match brand style: colors, mood, aesthetic aligned with your brand

## Real Example

Clarity beats cleverness: Changing a vague CTA ("Learn more") to a specific, action-focused CTA ("Get 2 months free") often reduces CPA in controlled A/B tests. Source: Meta Ads Help center guidance and industry case studies.
