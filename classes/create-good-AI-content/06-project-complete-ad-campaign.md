# Project: Create a Complete Ad Campaign

## Learning Objective

Build a complete ad campaign from concept to launch. Apply everything you've learned: model selection, prompt engineering, image-to-video workflow, and conversion optimization.

## Main Content

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Create a complete ad campaign for a product or service of your choice.

**Deliverables**:
1. Campaign strategy document
2. 5-10 image ad variations
3. 2-3 video ad variations (from winning images)
4. A/B testing plan
5. Optimization roadmap
6. Launch plan

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (depending on your pace)

**Tools**: genfeed.ai (recommended), or your AI tools of choice

## Step 1: Campaign Strategy

### Define Your Product/Service

**What are you selling?**
- Product name
- Key features
- Target price point
- Unique value proposition

**Write this down**. You'll reference it throughout.

### Define Your Audience

**Who are you selling to?**
- Demographics (age, gender, location)
- Psychographics (interests, values, pain points)
- Where they hang out online
- What messaging resonates with them

**Be specific**. Vague audiences = weak ads.

### Define Your Value Proposition

**Why should they care?**
- What problem does it solve?
- What benefit do they get?
- Why should they choose you?
- What makes it different?

**One sentence**: "I help [audience] [achieve outcome] by [unique method]."

### Define Your Goals

**What are you trying to achieve?**
- Primary goal (sales, leads, signups)
- Target conversion rate
- Target cost per conversion
- Budget
- Timeline

**Set clear goals**. You can't optimize without targets.

### Document Your Strategy

**Create a strategy document**:
- Product/service overview
- Target audience profile
- Value proposition
- Campaign goals
- Budget and timeline

**Don't skip this step**. Strategy comes first.

## Step 2: Image Ad Creation

### Generate Image Variations

**Using genfeed.ai or your chosen tool**:

1. **Product Showcase** (2 variations):
   - Product on white background, minimalist
   - Product in use, lifestyle

2. **Feature Highlight** (2 variations):
   - Key features visible
   - Benefits demonstrated

3. **Lifestyle Integration** (2 variations):
   - Product in natural setting
   - Target audience using product

4. **Emotional Appeal** (2 variations):
   - Aspirational context
   - Problem/solution narrative

5. **Creative/Standout** (2 variations):
   - Unique angle
   - Memorable visual

**Generate 10 image variations total**. Test different concepts.

### Review and Select Winners

**Criteria**:
- Composition works for ad placement
- Colors and style align with brand
- Message is clear
- Audience appeal is strong
- Technical quality is high

**Select 3-5 winners**. You'll convert these to video.

### Optimize Winning Images

**For each winner**:
- Test different crops (square, vertical, horizontal)
- Test different color variations
- Test different compositions
- Add text overlays if needed
- Add CTAs if appropriate

**Create 2-3 variations per winner**. Test what works.

## Step 3: Video Ad Creation

### Convert Images to Video

**Using genfeed.ai image-to-video**:

For each winning image (3-5 images):

1. **Upload image to genfeed.ai**
2. **Write video prompt**:
   - Reference the image
   - Describe motion
   - Maintain style and colors
   - Specify duration (15s, 30s)
   - Include conversion elements

3. **Generate 2-3 video variations per image**:
   - Different camera movements
   - Different motion speeds
   - Different durations

**Generate 6-15 video variations total**. Test what works.

### Review and Select Winners

**Criteria**:
- Motion is smooth and professional
- Message is clear
- Duration is appropriate
- Visual quality is high
- Conversion potential is strong

**Select 2-3 winning videos**. These will be your primary ads.

## Step 4: A/B Testing Plan

### Define Tests

**Test 1: Image vs. Video**
- Hypothesis: Video will convert better than image
- Variations: Best image ad vs. best video ad
- Metric: Conversion rate

**Test 2: Message Variations**
- Hypothesis: Specific benefit message will convert better
- Variations: 3 different value propositions
- Metric: Conversion rate

**Test 3: CTA Variations**
- Hypothesis: Urgency CTA will convert better
- Variations: 3 different CTAs
- Metric: Conversion rate

**Test 4: Visual Style**
- Hypothesis: Lifestyle visuals will convert better than product shots
- Variations: 2 different visual styles
- Metric: Conversion rate

**Create testing plan**. Test systematically.

### Set Up Tracking

**Track**:
- Impressions
- Clicks
- Conversions
- Cost per conversion
- Return on ad spend

**Set up tracking before launch**. You need data to optimize.

## Step 5: Launch Plan

### Choose Platforms

**Where will you run ads?**
- Facebook/Instagram
- Google Ads
- TikTok
- LinkedIn
- Other platforms

**Start with 1-2 platforms**. Don't spread too thin.

### Set Budget

**Budget allocation**:
- Testing budget (50%): Test variations
- Scaling budget (50%): Scale winners

**Start small**. Test before scaling.

### Launch Schedule

**Week 1**: Launch test campaigns
- Run A/B tests
- Collect data
- Monitor performance

**Week 2**: Analyze and optimize
- Review results
- Scale winners
- Kill losers
- Test new variations

**Week 3**: Scale winners
