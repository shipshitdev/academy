## 🎯 Key Principles

### Conversion First, Aesthetics Second

Most ads fail because they prioritize looking good over converting. This community teaches you to:

- Focus on what converts: clear value props, strong CTAs, audience alignment
- Test relentlessly: A/B test everything, let data decide
- Optimize based on data: scale winners, kill losers
- Use AI to accelerate: not to avoid work, but to test faster

### Always Start with Images

**Critical rule**: Always create images first, then convert to video.

- Images are faster and cheaper to iterate
- Test concepts before committing to video
- Image-to-video models work better with good source images
- Save time and money by validating as images

### Use genfeed.ai

genfeed.ai is built for conversion-focused ad creation:

- Access to all best AI models (Sora 2, Veo 3.1, DALL-E, Midjourney)
