# Image-to-Video: The Essential Workflow

## Learning Objective

Master the image-to-video workflow. Learn why you must always start with images, how to convert them to video, and how to maintain consistency across formats.

## Why You Must Start with Images

**The Reality**: Video generation is expensive and slow. Generating 10 video variations costs 10x more than generating 10 image variations. Most of those videos won't work.

**The Solution**: Start with images. Test 10 image concepts. Pick 2-3 winners. Convert those to video. Test video variations. Scale what converts.

**The Math**:
- 10 image variations: $5-10, 30 minutes
- 10 video variations: $50-100, 3-5 hours
- 10 image variations → 2 winners → 5 video variations: $25-50, 2 hours

**Always start with images**. You'll save time and money.

## The Image-to-Video Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Image Variations

**Goal**: Create 5-10 image variations testing different concepts.

**What to test**:
- Composition (product placement, framing)
- Colors (brand colors, mood)
- Style (photography style, aesthetic)
- Messaging (visual storytelling)
- Audience (different demographics, scenarios)

**Example**:
- Image 1: Product on white background, minimalist
- Image 2: Product in use, lifestyle
- Image 3: Product with features highlighted, technical
- Image 4: Product with emotional context, aspirational
- Image 5: Product with different angle, creative

**Generate all variations**. Test concepts as images first.

### Step 2: Select Winners

**Criteria**:
- Composition works for video (movement potential)
- Colors and style align with brand
- Message is clear
- Audience appeal is strong
- Technical quality is high

**Pick 2-3 winners**. Don't pick just one—test multiple directions.

### Step 3: Convert Images to Video

**The Process**:
1. Upload winning image to video generation model
2. Write prompt describing the motion you want
3. Generate video variations
4. Review and select best

**Critical**: Your video prompt should reference the image and describe motion.

### Step 4: Test Video Variations

**What to test**:
- Camera movement (zoom, pan, rotate)
- Motion speed (slow, normal, fast)
- Duration (5s, 15s, 30s)
- Transitions (cuts, fades, wipes)

**Generate 3-5 video variations per image**. Test what works.

### Step 5: Scale Winners

**Once you have winners**:
- Generate longer versions if needed
- Create variations for different platforms
- Test different CTAs
- Scale what converts

## Tools

- genfeed.ai (image→video pipelines)
- Runway Gen‑3, Pika 2.0 (fast tests)
- Sora 2, Veo 3.1 (final production)
- CapCut or Premiere (edits)

## Writing Video Prompts from Images

### The Structure

**Base Structure**:
```
Using this image as reference: [image], create a [duration]-second video showing [motion description], maintaining [style/colors/composition], [camera movement], [mood/feel], professional quality, ad-ready
```

### Motion Descriptions

**Product Shots**:
- "Slow zoom in on product"
- "Gentle rotation showing all angles"
- "Smooth camera orbit around product"
- "Close-up pan across key features"

**Lifestyle Shots**:
- "Natural movement of person using product"
- "Smooth transition from wide to close-up"
- "Gentle camera movement following action"
- "Slow-motion capture of key moment"

**Creative Shots**:
- "Dynamic camera movement through scene"
- "Smooth transitions between elements"
- "Cinematic motion matching mood"
- "Professional camera work emphasizing story"

### Examples

**Example 1: Product Video**

**Image**: Product on white background, minimalist

**Video Prompt**:
```
Using this image as reference: [product image], create a 15-second video starting with a close-up of the product, slowly zooming out to reveal the full device, then gentle rotation showing all angles, maintaining the clean minimalist aesthetic and white background, smooth camera movements, professional product photography style, commercial quality, ad-ready
```

**Example 2: Lifestyle Video**

**Image**: Person using product in natural setting

**Video Prompt**:
```
Using this image as reference: [lifestyle image], create a 30-second video showing natural movement of the person using the product, smooth camera movement following the action, transitioning from wide shot to close-up of product in use, maintaining natural lighting and authentic atmosphere, professional lifestyle photography style, commercial quality, ad-ready
```

**Example 3: Feature Highlight Video**

**Image**: Product with key features visible

**Video Prompt**:
```
Using this image as reference: [product image], create a 20-second video with smooth camera pan across the product, highlighting key features: [feature 1], [feature 2], [feature 3], maintaining professional product photography style, clean composition, studio lighting, commercial quality, ad-ready
```

## Maintaining Consistency

### Visual Consistency

**Colors**: Match the image colors exactly
- Reference the image's color palette in your prompt
- "Maintaining the vibrant blue and white color scheme from the image"

**Style**: Match the image style
- "Maintaining the minimalist aesthetic from the image"
- "Keeping the professional product photography style"

**Composition**: Match the image composition
- "Maintaining the product-focused composition"
- "Keeping the same framing and perspective"

### Brand Consistency

**Across all formats**:
- Same colors
- Same style
- Same mood
- Same messaging

**Test variations, maintain brand**. Don't sacrifice consistency for novelty.

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Skipping Image Step**
- Starting with video → Waste time and money

**Mistake 2: Poor Image Selection**
- Choosing images that don't work for video → Bad video results

**Mistake 3: Vague Motion Description**
- "Make it move" → Unclear results

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Image Reference**
- Not referencing the image in prompt → Inconsistent results

**Mistake 5: No Variation Testing**
- One video per image → Missing opportunities
