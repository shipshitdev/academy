# AI Models for Images and Videos

## Learning Objective

Learn which AI models to use for image and video generation. Understand when to use each model, their strengths, and how to get the best results for your ads.

## Main Content

## Image Generation Models

**DALL-E 3** (OpenAI):

- Best for: Product shots, realistic imagery, brand consistency
- Strengths: Follows prompts accurately, understands context, safe for commercial use
- Use when: You need predictable, high-quality product images
- Weaknesses: Less creative, more constrained

**Midjourney**:

- Best for: Artistic visuals, creative concepts, mood and atmosphere
- Strengths: Beautiful aesthetics, creative interpretation, strong community
- Use when: You need visually striking ads that stand out
- Weaknesses: Less control over exact details, requires Discord

**Stable Diffusion** (Open Source):

- Best for: Custom models, fine-tuning, specific styles
- Strengths: Open source, customizable, can train on your data
- Use when: You need specific brand styles or have technical resources
- Weaknesses: Requires more setup, less user-friendly

**Nano Bannan**:

- Best for: Fast iteration, cost-effective generation, bulk creation
- Strengths: Speed, affordability, API access
- Use when: You need to generate many variations quickly
- Weaknesses: Quality may vary, newer model with less track record

**For Ads**: Start with DALL-E 3 for product shots, Midjourney for creative concepts. Use Stable Diffusion if you need custom training. Use Nano Bannan for rapid testing.

## Video Generation Models

**Sora 2** (OpenAI):

- Best for: High-quality video ads, realistic motion, professional output
- Strengths: Best quality, realistic physics, long-form video, commercial licensing
- Use when: You need premium video ads that look professional
- Weaknesses: Longer generation time, higher cost

**Veo 3.1** (Google):

- Best for: Natural motion, complex scenes, multi-subject videos
- Strengths: Strong motion understanding, good for complex prompts
- Use when: You need videos with multiple subjects or complex actions
- Weaknesses: Newer model, less proven track record

**Runway Gen-3**:

- Best for: Image-to-video, fast iteration, creative effects
- Strengths: Excellent image-to-video conversion, fast generation, creative tools
- Use when: You're starting from images (which you should always do)
- Weaknesses: Shorter clips, less realistic than Sora 2

**Pika 2.0**:

- Best for: Quick tests, affordable generation, image-to-video
- Strengths: Speed, affordability, good image-to-video
- Use when: You need to test concepts quickly
- Weaknesses: Lower quality than Sora 2, shorter clips

**For Ads**: Use Sora 2 for final, high-quality ads. Use Veo 3.1 for complex scenes. Use Runway Gen-3 or Pika 2.0 for image-to-video workflows and testing.

## The Critical Rule: Always Start with Images

**Always create images first, then convert to video**. This is not optional. This is the workflow that works.

**Why**:

- Images are faster and cheaper to iterate
- You can test composition, colors, and messaging before committing to video
- Image-to-video models work better with good source images
- You save time and money by validating concepts as images

**The Workflow**:

1. Generate image variations (test 5-10 concepts)
2. Pick the winners
3. Convert winning images to video
4. Test video variations
5. Scale what converts

**Never start with video**. You'll waste time and money generating videos that don't work.

## Model Selection Guide

**For Product Ads**:

- Images: DALL-E 3
- Videos: Sora 2 (from DALL-E 3 images)

**For Creative/Artistic Ads**:

- Images: Midjourney
- Videos: Runway Gen-3 (from Midjourney images)

**For Fast Testing**:

- Images: Nano Bannan or DALL-E 3
- Videos: Pika 2.0 or Runway Gen-3

**For Final Production**:

- Images: DALL-E 3 or Midjourney (depending on style)
- Videos: Sora 2 or Veo 3.1

## genfeed.ai Integration

genfeed.ai gives you access to all these models in one platform:

- DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion for images
- Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Runway Gen-3 for videos
- Built-in image-to-video workflows
- A/B testing across models
- Analytics to see which models convert best

**Don't switch between 10 different tools**. Use genfeed.ai to access everything in one place, with conversion-focused workflows.

## Key Takeaways

- DALL-E 3 for product shots, Midjourney for creative concepts
- Sora 2 for high-quality video ads, Veo 3.1 for complex scenes
- Always start with images, then convert to video
- Test with cheaper models, scale with premium models
- Use genfeed.ai to access all models in one platform
- Match the model to your ad type and budget

## Next Steps

Now that you understand which models to use, let's learn how to write prompts that convert. The next module covers prompt engineering for ads.

## Action Items

- Research each model's pricing and limitations
- Test one image model (start with DALL-E 3 or Midjourney)
- Generate 5 image variations for a test ad
- Pick your winner
- Set up genfeed.ai account to access all models

## Tools

- genfeed.ai (unified model access and image→video workflow)
- DALL·E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion (images)
- Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Runway Gen‑3, Pika 2.0 (video)
- Meta Ads Experiments, Google Ads Experiments (A/B testing)
