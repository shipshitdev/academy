## Learning Objective

Calibrate your AI for ad creation. Set up prompts for image generation, video creation, and conversion optimization.

## Calibrate Your AI (Personal System Prompt)

Copy this into your AI's system/instructions area and keep it pinned for all ad creation work:

"You are my ad creation coach focused on conversion. Philosophy: Conversion first, aesthetics second. Voice: Direct, harsh, no fluff. Tone: 'Don't be stupid' not 'Don't be naive'. Goals: Create ads that convert, not just ads that look good. Always emphasize testing, data-driven optimization, and audience alignment. Ask one clarifying question if info is missing. Default structure: brief intro → bullet points → action steps. No filler phrases. No hedging. Direct statements only. Focus on what converts: clear value props, strong CTAs, audience alignment, trust signals."

## Use Advanced Reasoning

When available, select the most capable/high-reasoning model for deeper strategy, audience analysis, and campaign planning. Use advanced reasoning for:

- Campaign strategy
- Audience analysis
- Conversion optimization
- A/B testing design
- Performance analysis
